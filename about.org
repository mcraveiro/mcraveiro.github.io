* Quick Bio

The bio from my [[https://github.com/mcraveiro][GitHub profile]] is still fairly accurate:

#+begin_quote
Dad, Husband, PhD, Senior Software Engineer, FX Derivatives geek,
Angolan-Portuguese.
#+end_quote

* Programming

I've spent a quarter of a century programming professionally, almost all of
which in the United Kingdom --- though I did do a couple of quick escapades to
Angola and Portugal. My main focus over the last twenty or so years has been the
financial sector --- the FX derivatives market in particular. I am currently
gainfully employed and therefore not looking for opportunities.

* Academia

I did a PhD thesis which may (or may not) be of interest: [[https://uhra.herts.ac.uk/handle/2299/25708][Model Assisted
Software Development --- a MDE-Based Software Development Methodology]]. As part
of that work, I wrote a few papers:

- [[https://zenodo.org/records/5790875#.YkoSutDMKXI][Survey of Special Purpose Code Generators]]
- [[https://zenodo.org/records/5767247#.YkoS6NDMKXI][Experience Report of Industrial Adoption of Model Driven Development in the
  Financial Sector]]
- [[https://zenodo.org/records/5812017#.YkmlftDMKXI][Notes on Model Driven Engineering]]

On my spare time I continue to work on this topic over at the [[https://masd-project.github.io/progen/index.html][MASD Project]]. My
/alma matter/ is the [[https://www.herts.ac.uk/][University of Hertfordshire]].

* Languages

My mother tongue is Portuguese, but I speak English fluently enough (though my
kids may tell you otherwise). I can survive in Spanish and, if really pushed,
rather badly in French. My favourite expression, which I heard our [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo][Congolese
neighbours]] say a lot is /Je me dÃ©brouille/.
