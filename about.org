* Quick Bio

The bio from my [[https://github.com/mcraveiro][GitHub profile]] is still fairly accurate:

#+begin_quote
Dad, Husband, PhD Student, Senior Software Engineer, FX Derivatives
geek, Angolan-Portuguese.
#+end_quote

* Programming

I've spent over twenty years programming professionally, almost all of
which spent in the United Kingdom, with a few escapades in Angola and
Portugal. My main focus over the last fifteen or so years has been the
financial sector - in particular the FX derivatives market. I am
currently gainfully employed and therefore not looking for
opportunities.

* Domain Driven Consulting

On my spare time I also manage my company Domain Driven Consulting,
focusing on software automation - the subject of which is my PhD
thesis, which I will hope to publish soon (famous last words). My
/alma matter/ is the [[https://www.herts.ac.uk/][University of Hertfordshire]].

* Languages

I speak fluently English and Portuguese, but I can survive in Spanish
and if really pushed, maybe in French; my favourite expression, which
I heard our [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo][Congolese neighbours]] say many a time is /Je me
d√©brouille/.
