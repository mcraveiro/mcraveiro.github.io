<p>
If you're a young Angolan in the diaspora you cannot have failed to
notice the talk surrounding "the return home". These days, its the hot
topic of conversation everywhere you go. Unfortunately, a very large
number of the young diasporians don't really know much about their
country, other than what they read in the papers and hear on the
news. This sort of information won't help you make one of the most
important decisions of your life. So, in typical hacker fashion, I
decided to fill in the gap, providing here the details I would have
wanted to read when researching the topic. Most of the information is
hear-say, so take it with a pinch of salt.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org60f7020" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org60f7020">Politics: War and Peace</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org60f7020">
<p>
The first and foremost reason for the wave of optimism surrounding the
country is peace. War started before many of us diasporians were born
and continued on and off until very recently. Whilst the last five
years have been very positive, one cannot help but remember that
Angola has been the graveyard of many believers who misread their
cards. So the million dollar question is "how do we know if peace is
here to stay this time?". Its a tough one.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to try to steer clear from too many political judgements and
discussions here, as we all know how important politics are for all
Angolans and how attached people are to their parties. However, I
think there is a broad consensus with regards to how peace was
obtained: the deciding factor was the death of Jonas Savimbi. The die
was cast then. Savimbi represented the aspirations of a large segment
of the Angolan population, but he was also the iconic image of the
Freedom Fighter of old, the bush fighter, the personification of a
Guevarian "Liberdad o Muerte". Like many of his ilk, he would never
compromise. Truth is, while MPLA deserves a lot of credit for the
peace, its tally is probably less than what is claimed. UNITA's
military undoing was in the making for a while now, starved as it was
of support from its key allies and sources of revenue. The world
around us changed dramatically, but UNITA failed to change with it. We
are now living in a brave new world, a place were the rivalries are
fought in the commercial arena rather than by guerrilla war, and where
nations are a lot less inclined to support rebels on the grounds of
their political inclinations. (In turn we now have religion to worry
about, but that's another story).
</p>

<p>
For good or bad, UNITA is now a shadow of itself since the demise of
its leader; whilst extremely competent, the remaining members of the
party are not of the same mold as Savimbi. These people are much more
inclined to try to win via the ballot box rather than going back to
the bush. In other words, war as we knew it is very unlikely to
return.
</p>

<p>
For pretty much the same reasons, FNLA or any other Cabindan
independence parties are not likely to cause problems. Small
skirmishes in territory are bound to continue for a while, but its
clear that Cabinda will not obtain its independence, not while the oil
revenues are so significant for the development of the country as a
whole. The new statutes of autonomy will probably be enough to please
the Cabindan people, if not their leaders - but the reality is they
will never develop any significant military power capable of
destabilising the country. So much for parties other than MPLA.
</p>

<p>
The key factor in determining Angola's political stability is MPLA
itself. The party has been headed by Jose Eduardo dos Santos since
Agostinho Neto's untimely death, several decades ago. Many things can
be said about dos Santos years in power, but very few can fault his
executive for their macro-economic performance over the last four or
five years. Inflation has been finally tamed and successive
challenging targets have been met; the Kwanza has been stable; some
progress has been made with regards to transparency and management of
the oil revenues. Don't take me wrong: huge, massive amounts still
remain to be done at the macro-economic level and in terms of economic
reform - and these are the areas the government has focused on, so you
can imagine every other level. But the general direction taken is
extremely encouraging. This is not an opinion, its a fact validated by
the huge influx of FDI. The fundamentals are more or less in place.
</p>

<p>
But, like everything else in life, there's always a snag. Elections
are coming soon to Angola. There is very little doubt MPLA will win,
the opposition being in total disarray; and there is little doubt MPLA
will ensure the elections are free and fair, so confident they are of
winning and so much importance they place in being accepted by the
political world at large. The question is, who will be at the helm of
the party? And even if it is Zedu, as Dos Santos is affectionately
known by all Angolans, how long can he stay in power? After all, he is
getting old. Who will succeed him? Will he or she be able to hold the
party - and thus the nation - together? Those are fundamental
questions. Many say the M (MPLA) is a very strong institution, one
capable of raising above internal disputes. After all, this was how
Zedu was found that many years ago, a virtually unknown character in
the party taking over at a crucial juncture. Yet others point to the
ANC post Mbeki and to the instability the succession is creating. This
is by far the most important political challenge the country is going
to face over the next few years.
</p>

<p>
I'm inclined to believe the party will provide a suitable candidate
post Zedu, but that's the optimist in me.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgbb01433" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgbb01433">The Economy: Realistic Expectations</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbb01433">
<p>
As I mentioned earlier, the economy - or should I say the
macro-economy - is doing fairly well. FDI is booming, one of the
largest in the world. Inflation and currency are under control. The
biggest problem is the excessive dependency on oil, but unlike the IMF
I think its probably best to ignore this caveat. Lets face the facts:
there is no Angola without oil. It is and has been by far the largest
source of revenue in the country, something like 90% of GDP. And the
second largest source of revenue is probably equally bad, the dreaded
diamonds. Even a mildly competent economist can tell you that
depending on commodities is a recipe for disaster, this being more
common sense than anything else - basket and eggs come to
mind. Schoolbooks tell us that diversification is the key. However,
one has to face reality. The way I see it, if your country has one
really strong competitive advantage, might as well make use of
it. Depending on oil is a given. It will take decades to loosen up
this dependency, and there's very little one can do in the short
term. More importantly, one has to focus on how the oil money is being
used.
</p>

<p>
In this regard, whilst there is the usual large amount of wastage,
what surprised me the most is how much is actually being done. The
government's program of reconstruction is very large and it
encompasses almost every area of the country. The plan seems to focus
first on infrastructure. These are areas such as roads linking the
provinces, dams to produce electricity and water and key
industries. There is also a very large focus on education, with many
schools being built over the last few years.
</p>

<p>
Look, don't take me wrong: Angola could be miles ahead if every cent
of the oil money was used properly. We would be South Korea in ten
years. This is not the way to look at reality. One has to benchmark
oneself by looking at one's peers, and Angola's peers are Nigeria,
Liberia, Namibia, Equatorial Guinea and other such commodity dependent
developing countries. In that regard, I think we have to judge
Angola's performance as above the average. The crux is not that every
single cent of oil money has been used properly; it is that some of
this money actually found its way to the people, and this amount is
increasing with every budget.
</p>

<p>
Another criticism that is being made is that Angola is focusing too
much on large public works such as the Kapanda dam and forgetting
about the little things that can improve the people's lives. This is,
again, a text book criticism clearly inspired by an utopian view of
the world. In theory, theory is always right, in practise it seldom
is. Show me a single country that was made competitive by ignoring
large public infrastructure works and focusing exclusively on the
people. Was this what the Marshall plan favoured when Europe was in
total chaos? Lets be honest, this just cannot be done. For starters,
its much easier to ensure these large works are completed successfully
than it is to measure the success of social targets. Misquoting
Sitglitz, its all about sequencing and pacing and you can't run before
you've learned how to crawl. If you haven't got a competent workforce
to deliver public services, what's the point of putting them in your
budget? As an example, the government itself admitted in the very
state controlled public television TPA that one of the problems they
found with education was they were building schools too fast to staff
them, so they had to resort to less qualified teachers to fill in the
gap. They are now focusing on teacher training to help alleviate this
problem.
</p>

<p>
Enough ranting. Angola is currently focusing almost all of its capital
on developing infrastructure, very much along the lines of the
Shanghaise school of thought. There are large amounts of waste due to
corruption and mismanagement, but this is to be expected, and is in
line with its peers. Some of these public works have been completed
successfully, many are still on the pipeline.

<div id="outline-container-org6f4859e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org6f4859e">Jobs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6f4859e">
<p>
The job market has to be broken into two segments: qualified personnel
and non-qualified personnel. On the qualified personnel front, the
booming economy is creating a very large number of positions, many of
which cannot be filled. One of the reasons is the Angolanisation
process. Similar to BEE in South Africa, Angolanisation is a form of
positive discrimination that gives priority to Angolan citizens in job
applications. Multinational companies working on Angolan soil have to
fill in a minimum quota of Angolan personnel. There is also a second
incentive for hiring Angolans: they are much cheaper than
expats. Angola was already lacking qualified people before the
economic boom, but now the situation is dramatic. If you search the
web you'll quickly notice that many companies are now bringing job
fairs to Europe, trying desperately to entice the diaspora to come
back. The main reasons is that most diasporians have university
degrees and these are in great demand. Any degree will open doors,
really, but I noticed a particularly large demand for Engineering,
Information Technology, Accounting and Business Administration. The
Angolan universities are churning out large amounts of law graduates,
so I suspect these are in less demand. However, if you have good
working experience in any field, my guess is you wouldn't struggle to
find a job. For instance, there is huge demand for tradesman like
plumbers and air conditioning technicians. Many of these people are
getting in with high-school or 9th grade. One thing that employers
particularly like from the diasporians is the work ethic: most people
tend to turn up on time and leave late everyday, take few breaks
during the day and rarely miss days due to sickness or otherwise. This
is highly valued in Angola because the work culture there is much more
relaxed. Work absenteeism is a big problem.
</p>

<p>
But before you jump on the next plane, bear the following in mind:
</p>

<p>
Do not come to Angola without a job lined up, from a reputable
company. You can easily change jobs when you come here, but the first
one will be the hardest.  Make sure you get a good wage (1500 USD
month is the absolute bare minimum). Life is very expensive. When
discussing your package, make sure you cover: health insurance, car,
housing (probably not going to get it, but should always try),
holidays. Renting and cost of living in Luanda are very high so make
sure your wage covers it. Its sensible to budget around 1000 USD month
for accommodation.  Make sure your company will help you out with
accommodation. If they are not willing to pay for it, ask them to at
least find it for you. Ensure they will provide some kind of temporary
accommodation until you manage to move out, since it will take you a
long time to find a place to live.  For the diaspora, make sure you
have your papers in order. If you haven't got Angolan papers anymore,
try finding out if your birth certificate is still there. Most
companies will only hire you if you have a valid Angolan ID card and
passport, so you'll probably have to get these before you start
applying for jobs.  Make all possible efforts to find a job in the
provinces. Its extremely unlikely you'll find one, but if you do
you're sorted. However, the reality is you will most likely have to
work in Luanda. Its probably a good idea to go there for a week or so
on holidays to get a feel for the place. This will be an expensive
exercise.  If you are not Angolan, don't despair. There are plenty of
job opportunities for foreigners too, in particular if you are a
fluent Portuguese speaker. There are many Brazilians and Portuguese
working in Luanda, as well as foreigners from other countries such as
USA, England, South-Africa, France and many other countries. You may
even be able to find a job without speaking Portuguese, but I guess
there are not that many of these. As a foreigner you must make sure
you have all of your papers in order at all times, including visa and
work permits. The government is very strict, and you may be asked for
papers at any time. Also, when discussing the job package make sure
the cost of the work permit is fully covered by the company employing
you.  If you have any friends or family in the country contact
them. You will need a lot of help.  Be prepared to wait. Things will
take a very long time to happen, both at the corporate level and
especially at the government level.  Don't expect a relaxed life at
work. You will have to do the same hours as you would in Europe or
USA, and working late is pretty common. Pressure will be perhaps a bit
less intense, but this will vary a lot from company to company.  There
are also positive aspects to take into account:
</p>

<p>
The wages are higher than what many diasporians can aspire to in
Europe and USA, particularly if you just graduated from university.
Most companies will throw you in at the deep end. Managerial positions
that would take you years to obtain in Europe or America are routinely
given to very young people.  Most people I have met truly believe that
they are helping their country by creating economic growth. This
feeling of achievement is hard to come by in developed countries,
where one tends to feel just like another cog in a big machine. In
Angola you truly feel like you are making a difference. Of course, it
still remains to be seen whether this growth is really going to create
the development the country needs, but for the moment most people are
optimistic.  With regards to the non-qualified personnel, the
situation is very different. Like very much all of southern Africa,
Angola is struggling to provide employment for most of its
citizens. Numbers are hard to come by, and they cannot be fully
trusted since there has not been any proper data collection for a
while, but many sources believe unemployment is higher than 50%. Now,
the thing is, 50% is not just a number - not just ten times more than
a normal western country; at this sorts of thresholds, the average
western country would be facing social and economic meltdown. Of
course, this being Africa, there is a kind of normality in these
abnormal conditions. The war created a very large exodus from the
country side to the capital. In the past, Huambo was the most densely
populated province; this role was taken over by Luanda, on a grand
scale. Again, figures are sketchy - we won't know for sure until the
electoral registration process is completed - but some sources believe
that there are more than 8 million people living in Luanda. Most of
these live in shanty towns (mussueques) and do not have official
jobs. Instead, they make a living in the parallel economy, most likely
in commerce.
</p>

<p>
Its very difficult to find official non-qualified work, and when you
do its probably not going to be paid that well. A security guard makes
around 100 to 150 USD a month, a sum that seems handsome for any third
world country but in Luanda is next to nothing. Just getting to work
will cost you 2 USD a day or more, and you'll be stuck in traffic for
hours on end. With the economic boom, there has been significant job
creation at the lower ends of the market - construction in
particular. However, this has only made a small dent on the overall
employment because Luanda is so overpopulated. The government is keen
on creating incentives for people to move out of the capital, and
indeed the quality of living outside Luanda is much better for the
poorer people. The problem is, many of the mussueque inhabitants have
been in Luanda for ten or twenty years, and are not very easily
persuaded to go elsewhere. Some - the young crowd in particular - are
urbanites and will not be able to adapt to rural life. For these
people, finding a job is very hard. Many people work as taxi drivers,
cleaning ladies, security guards or salesman of one sort or
other. Many are just bayaye, people that find one job today, none
tomorrow.

<h3 id="orgd09056f">Corruption</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd09056f">
<p>
Like every other third world country, Angola suffers from corruption
at all levels. The root cause for corruption in the civil service are
the low wages. In general, things will work much slower unless you
provide some additional stimulus, the gasosa. The government is trying
to address this issue by trimming down the public sector and
increasing wages, but this is a very hard thing to achieve and should
be seen as a long term objective. After all, corruption is rife in
countries like China and India and they are still able to grow at a
very fast pace.

<h3 id="org83c8ff9">Health</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org83c8ff9">
<p>
Overall, one has to say that health in Angola is pretty good. The
biggest downside is its cost, which makes it unavailable to a large
percentage of the population. However, the "middle-class" can choose
between a large number of private clinics. These are rather expensive
in Luanda, and one outing to the doctor can cost you as much as 200
USD if you're not careful. Outside of Luanda, in the provinces, the
costs are much lower and in general the service seems to be much
better too. The good thing about these private clinics is that they
will see you almost instantly.
</p>

<p>
With regards to medicine, chemists seem to have all the drugs one can
find in Europe, many of which at the same prices or slightly lower. In
general though, these are expensive.
</p>

<p>
With regards to the public health service, this is in its infancy but
the government has spent quite a lot of money in creating new
hospitals and clinics and in refurbishing the existing ones. We went
past quite a few in Luanda (such as Josina Marchel) but we didn't
actually go inside so we cannot comment on the quality of service. Be
prepared to wait for a while to be seen though.

<h3 id="org73d29a3">Crime</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org73d29a3">
<p>
This is one of the most surprising things about Angola: in general,
its actually a pretty quiet sort of country. Luanda is definitely the
epicentre of all crime and violence in Angola, but unlike other big
African cities - Jo'burg comes to mind - it doesn't make you feel like
you're about to be mugged every time you leave the house. Don't take
me wrong, Luanda is, by European standards, a very dangerous
place. But if you are not carrying any valuables or wearing nice
clothes, and if you are walking in the parts of town which are known
to be safe its unlikely you'll get mugged. Night time is obviously
more dangerous than daytime.
</p>

<p>
You should avoid going on Candongueiros (combi taxis), in particular
the ones that go across town, although we personally made extensive
use of them and had no problems at all. Also, while Angola is a pretty
integrated country its important to remember that colour is an obvious
tag; non-black people stand out a lot more in poorer places (mulattoes
included), so make sure you know the area and the locals well. For
instance, very few non-blacks use candongueiros so you will be an
obvious target.
</p>

<p>
On the negative side, you will need to be careful when driving a car,
particularly nice looking ones, and when going to or leaving your flat
and job. You will probably want to have a security guard in your
house, or one for the building if you live in a flat. We've heard
quite a few stories of people getting mugged inside their own
buildings. Its also a good idea to go out in large groups at night.
</p>

<p>
But overall, I must say though that Luanda is not in the same league
as South Africa when it comes to crime. The main difference seems to
be that most crime is not violent; that is, people are happy to mug
you and run - or beat you up if your mobile phone is not one of the
latest generation - but they are unlikely to shoot you or stab you. It
happens occasionally, of course, but not frequently. In South Africa,
the situation is very different. A lot of robbers kill and rape, its
seen as part of the course. I think the main reason for it is the
heavy presence of police in Angola. We saw policemen in every town we
went to, many of them on the beat. In South Africa you seldom see a
police officer.
</p>

<p>
Outside of Luanda its a different matter altogether. If one excludes
problematic areas such as Cabinda and parts of the Lundas, all
provinces are extremely safe. In Namibe and Benguela, for example, you
can actually walk round with your valuables, day or night. Be sure to
ask the locals, of course.

<div id="outline-container-org2cb8817" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2cb8817">Housing</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2cb8817">
<p>
As we said previously, housing is a big problem in Angola, especially
in Luanda. There just aren't enough houses available to go round so
the house prices are, if you'll pardon the pun, up the roof. The
private sector was quick to detect the opportunity, and Luanda is now
one big building site. Unfortunately, most of these new constructions
are expensive buildings and private condominiums, completely secluded
from the rest of the city. These normally sell out well before
completion and are horrendously expensive. For instance, we heard that
a new set of flats going up near the Marginal has units at over 1M USD
and is completely sold out. We also saw a nice new condominium being
built by Soares da Costa where some houses cost over 500K USD. You can
find some houses for 200K but you'll have to look really hard.
</p>

<p>
The other problem is that many of the existing houses and flats are
actually not that nice, although they are really expensive. Some old
houses are being sold for an absolute fortune. If you decide to rent,
the situation is also difficult. For instance, its common for
landlords to make "agreements" with tenants which are not particularly
beneficial for the tenants. For instance, many landlords require you
to renovate the house. In return they will give you a slightly lower
rent (not that low, really) for a specified period of time (say one or
two years). After that period elapses, the rent goes up. If you can't
afford it, you'll have to move out and renovate somewhere else. Some
of the renovation work is pretty extensive, including painting the
whole flat, putting new flooring or new plumbing, buying furniture,
etc. Because the shortage of houses is so severe, tenants have no
option but to put up with these requirements.
</p>

<p>
Thing is, if there is one thing Angola has lots of, it is
space. Luanda is surrounded by huge expanses of empty land. The
government noticed this too and decided to create a whole brand new
Luanda in Luanda Sul. Many of these projects are private, such as
Belas Shopping. Some are government led and focus on affordability,
such as Lar do Patriota. These are normally housing cooperatives, and
work as follows: you join the cooperative by paying a fee and a
monthly instalment (normally a small amount); the cooperative starts
building houses, and handing them out on a first-come first-served
basis. The money you have payed till then is taken out of the overall
cost of the house, and you then start paying a regular mortgage. These
projects started off at very reasonable prices such as 60K USD but
have since gone up quite significantly - although still much less than
the private condominiums. Some people complained of corruption and
inferior quality materials in these projects, but the houses we saw
looked rather nice, if somewhat small. The only problem is that the
infrastructure surrounding these projects is not moving as fast as the
building so in some cases people have moved in before the tarmac has
reached their neighbourhood. In addition, Luanda Sul is mainly a
residential area at the moment, so you have to commute to central
Luanda for work. This is easier said than done, with the massive
traffic jams Luanda experiences every day. And when the rains begin,
its even worse.
</p>

<p>
Another peculiarity about housing in Luanda is electricity and water -
or lack of, should I say. This problem is a lot less prevailing in
Luanda Sul, but quite common everywhere else. Basically, you never
know when electricity and water are going to be available. Sometimes
it can be up to a week or more without it. Well-off people have
generators for the electricity and tanks for the water, but the
diaspora moving in has no access to these facilities.
</p>

<p>
Finally, one last note about construction. It is cheap enough to buy
land and build a house (well, cheap in Luandan terms). A plot of land
in Luanda Sul can cost you as little as 10K-20K USD. However, building
a house in Angola is not for the faint of heart. Everyone I spoke to
said its an incredibly difficult undertaking, costing large sums of
money - nothing goes according to plan - and huge amounts of time -
the paperwork is difficult and managing staff is impossible.

<h3 id="org818b9cc">Banking</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org818b9cc">
<p>
At this point in time, you cannot use VISA cards in Angola to access
your international accounts. The Multicaixa network (the network of
ATMs) is looking into it and expects to solve this major problem in
the first or second quarter of 2007. This is a major bummer and means
you won't be able to get any money out, so you'll have to have lots of
hard cash on you. Some places (very few) accept credit cards, but
there aren't that many, really. Whilst we all wait for Multicaixa,
there are two alternatives to get money out: a) you can either
transfer your money to a person you trust with a bank account in
Angola, which will cost you less than 5% in charges; or b) use Western
Union. This is slightly more expensive, but its very efficient; money
is made available within the hour. The only downside is queueing. The
only offices available in Luanda appear to be in Mutamba (Millennium
Bank), and they are always very crowded.
</p>

<p>
In terms of opening a bank account, the banks in Angola seem pretty
efficient. You'll find quite a few Portuguese banks there (BESA,
Totta, Millennium, etc.). Unfortunately, you cannot access Portuguese
accounts from the Angolan counterparts, you need to actually open up a
new account on Angolan soil. As far as I could ascertain, you need an
Angolan passport or a valid work visa to open an account, and the
process seems very easy and quick. With the account, you'll most
likely get a Multicaixa card and there are plenty of ATMs around to
withdraw money from. Most of them have security guards, but one should
always be careful when getting money out. Note that you cannot use
your Multicaixa card outside of Angola.

<h3 id="orgafb5894">Cost of Living</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgafb5894">
<p>
The cost of living in Angola is pretty high, and in Luanda is
extremely high. We've already seen how housing is expensive. Groceries
and other household goods are also very expensive; in many cases, are
as expensive as they would be in Europe, in countries where wages are
much higher. Some goods are actually more expensive in Angola than
elsewhere. For instance a carton of juice costs around 3 USD. Bread is
quite good and cheap, but cheese, ham and other items are very
expensive.
</p>

<p>
Eating out is extremely expensive. A meal out in an average restaurant
will cost you no less than 15 USD. Some more upmarket places charge as
much as 40 USD for some dishes. Two people would normally spend
between 50 to 100 USD when going to a restaurant.
</p>

<p>
Clubs and bars are also expensive. For instance, we were charged 20
USD to get in to Bar In in Ilha. This includes drinks (around 8
whiskies worth). You can haggle in some of these places and get the
doorman to reduce the bill.
</p>
</div>

<h3 id="orgc56feb4">Travelling</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc56feb4">
<p>
Owning a car in Angola is a must. This should preferably be a 4x4, as
there are many roads you can't actually negotiate without one. This is
particularly important if you intend to drive to the
provinces. Although there is a network of public transport, it doesn't
cover a significant area and the service it provides is rather
haphazard. This is changing somewhat with recent investments, but it
will take a while. Most locals use candongueiros (Toyota Hiaces) or
taxis to get everywhere, and in the provinces kupapatas (motorbike
taxis).
</p>

<p>
If you do own a car and live in Luanda, you are bound to spend the
vast majority of your driving time stuck in a traffic jam. This is
partially due to the inadequate state of the roads but also to do with
the sheer number of cars on the roads. Driving in the capital is not
for the faint of heart.
</p>

<p>
In terms of travelling to the provinces, the best method is by
plane. There are several companies that fly to the provinces, and
prices normally start around 100 USD for a single. If you go with one
of the more reputable companies such as SonAir and Air Gemini you
shouldn't have many problems with cancellations and other
mishaps. TAAG is not recommended for internal flights (but its fine
for international flights). If you are more adventurous you can try
going by bus using SGO Interprovincial. This is not advisable, in
particular from Luanda. Most roads in Angola are in pretty bad
condition. One trip that is very safe to do by bus is from Lubango to
Namibe though, where the roads are absolutely excellent. Lastly, you
can also travel by candongueiro or other informal drivers to the
different provinces. This is not at all recommended.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5331bae" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5331bae">Internet, TV</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5331bae">
<p>
Access to the web is fairly common, and there are several cyber cafe's
available, in particular in Luanda. However, the quality of the links
these cafes use is very low. As a result, access is slow and
haphazard, with frequent downtimes. It can stop functioning for 10
minutes or so during the hour you've paid for, and the cyber will not
take any responsibility for it. In addition, web access is not
cheap. An hour costs 250 Kwanzas (a bit less than 3 USD).
</p>

<p>
Internet to the house is not very common, but it does exist. It can be
as expensive as 70 USD a month, and its not particularly
fast. However, cable is now becoming available, and with it the
promise of broadband. In addition, the government intends to link all
provinces via fibre optic by 2009 and some of this work has already
started.
</p>

<p>
In terms of TV, the most common provider is DSTV, a South African
satellite company. This gives you access to a lot of Portuguese
speaking channels such as Brazilian and Portuguese TV, as well as the
usual international channels. There is also state TV but most people
(including the poorest) have satellite TV.

<p>
Other than being expensive, night-life in Luanda is actually pretty
good. There are many bars to choose from, and the crowds in those bars
are pretty posh. Many of these bars look rather impressive, and have
really good music. Electronic music is now the most common, and whilst
there is some cheesy dance music there is also a lot of good House and
Techno. Its harder to find bars with African music (Kizomba in
particular) but they do exist. There are still quite a few clubs with
Kizomba though, plenty to choose from.
</p>

<p>
There is a large choice of restaurants in Luanda, all
expensive. Whilst the food is not bad, the service normally
is. Perhaps its because Angolan waiters don't get paid on tips, but
whatever the reason is, most waiters are rather rude. Even the most
expensive places seem to have problems with their staff, including
Hotel Tropico and Cais De Quatro. You just get this feeling people
don't want to be there.
</p>

<p>
In terms of the provinces, there are less places to choose from, and
the staff normally is slightly less rude.

<h3 id="org8505124">Quality of Living</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8505124">
<p>
In general, and even taking into account problems such as no
electricity or water for extended periods of time, it has to be said
that most of the young qualified people have a good standard of
living. In fact, this is one of the biggest pluses of living in
Angola, and stems from the fact that wages for qualified staff are
high, allowing people to enjoy themselves on their time off. Provinces
such as Benguela and Namibe are particularly remarkable in this
regard, but Luanda has a lot to offer too.
</p>

<p>
Other than tropical rain, weather is pretty good almost all year round
in most provinces. For Luandans, weekends are normally spent at the
beach, either the closer ones such as Ilha or Mussulo or slightly
further out (Cabo Ledo, Porto Amboim). A lot of the well-off people
have beach houses, boats and jet-ski's and use them on weekends. Those
who haven't got these items normally know someone who knows someone
who has them.
</p>

<p>
Many people are now travelling to the provinces and exploring the
countryside. There are many extremely beautiful places, and people are
now making the effort to see them. The tourism industry is still in
its infancy, but the well-off segment of the population is pushing it
up.
</p>

<p>
This, of course, has to be contrasted with the vast majority of
Angolans, who enjoy a very low standard of living. The contrast is
perhaps one of the most challenging aspects of the whole experience,
and it will probably take quite a while to adapt to living in a place
with such huge disparities between rich and poor.
