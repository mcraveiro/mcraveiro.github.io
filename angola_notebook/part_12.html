<p>
Our return from Benguela to Luanda was planned to be fairly painless,
even potentially pleasant: we decided to fly back. There had been just
too many travelling adventures to recount and we needed just a little
bit of easiness, just that little bit of quietness for a
change. However, this being Angola, flying was not entirely
straightforward. We had spoken to Teresa, who convinced us not to buy
a ticket beforehand. Recalling some of her experiences, she told us
that at one time she had bought three plane tickets for a single
flight - no refunds given, of course. Best to go to the airport
without a ticket and buy one there and then, she suggested. This we
did. Although candongueiro routes didn't seem to service the airport,
it was easy enough to get there via taxi. When we arrived, we were
immediately asked whether we had a ticket or not. We didn't. From that
point onwards, the attendant started behaving in a shady sort of way,
looking both ways before talking and speaking really low. Actually,
everyone in the small airport suddenly seemed to act in a fishy way,
like they were all in a secret we didn't know. The chap told us not to
buy a ticket, and to stay in the empty waiting room till further
notice. After a while he showed up again, said there was a potential
flight, possibly via Lubango. Were we interested? If yes, he had to
part with 230 USD. Unfortunately we didn't have any change, something
he quickly picked up on, and somehow he managed to convince us he
deserved the extra 20 bucks for the effort of sorting it all
out. Within seconds the attendant was gone and, with him, our 250
bucks. Yet another of those cartoon moments - you know, like when Bugs
Bunny cons Elmer Fudd into doing something really, really silly, and a
couple of donkey ears appear on his head before he realises the
mistake. Those kind of moments. There you are, no attendant, no ticket
and no money. It was hard to explain just exactly at which point did
it seem like a good idea to give a total stranger a wad of cash and
trust his goodwill. Oh well, now there was nothing else to do other
than wait, so we waited and prayed for his safe return. Meanwhile a
small plane landed. Eventually, our contact returned. He had spoken to
the pilots, and there was now a direct flight to Luanda and we were on
it; all we had to do is wait for the DEFA registration, and then board
the plane. A little while longer, another half-an-hour or so, the DEFA
person called us to fill in the paperwork. Whenever you do an internal
flight in Angola you need to fill in some information like your
passport details, where you're staying, and so on. Perhaps some
remnants of the old, control-freak communist system. Once this was
done, we waited some more. Some additional people got into the waiting
room. Soon the pilots came round and called us for boarding. We all
boarded a really small plane, seventeen seats in total, ten or twelve
of them filled. And that was it, we were on our way to Luanda. As we
were flying, some aspects of the process became clear. No tickets were
ever issued. Our presence totally evaded the airline's ticketing
system, and the money got paid directly to our attendant and the
pilots. Thank God the plane didn't crash or otherwise no one would
have ever known our whereabouts. On the positive side, the flight was
excellent. We had never flown on a small aeroplane before but it was a
great experience. You can see everything, and feel a lot closer to the
sky as if you're skydiving or something. The sights were stunning.
</p>

<p>
When we got closer to Luanda, we started to see the effects of the
rains. Estadio dos Coqueiros was completely flooded, and looked like a
giant swimming pool. Most musseques were flooded too. There was water
everywhere. We had missed the first real rains in Luanda, the rains
that Elsa dreaded so much.

<p>
One thing we haven't mentioned much is the VISA renewal process. Don't
be fooled into thinking that it hasn't kept us busy - quite the
contrary. On hindsight, almost ever since we got into the country we
have been doing something related to the VISA; when we weren't
actually physically going to places, we had to at least ring people or
pray for things to get done soon. But lets go back in time, to last
December. We first went in to DEFA to figure out the exact
requirements and buy the forms. We were then told by a contact that we
needed a letter signed by notary stating that someone was taking
responsibility for us, and the photocopy of this person's ID card. Our
cousin Rosa kindly sorted this out for us, but the entire process of
getting the forms, filling them in, writing the letter, getting the
notary to sign it and photocopying the ID card took over three
weeks. There was even a point when we almost despaired, we only
noticed the letter had the wrong date on it after the notary had
already authenticated the signature, but since we didn't have enough
time to get a new one, we had to go with it as it was. Just before we
boarded the plane to Benguela, a mere three days before our VISAs
expired, we managed to hand in the forms and our passports. In return
we received a receipt, and were told that it had the same legal value
of our passports whilst we were on Angolan soil - best not lose it if
we wanted to avoid prison. There wasn't a date for the completion of
the process and it wasn't unheard of it taking months. We asked
around, and people thought we should be able to go on internal flights
with the receipt, but no one was entirely sure. This helped us on our
decision of going by bus to Benguela. In fact, we only found out for
sure when we boarded the plane back from Benguela; the receipt does
work fine. When we returned two weeks later, we were told the
passports were not ready yet. We wanted to go to Namibe as quickly as
possible, but we also wanted to have the passports with us, so we
decided to wait around a bit more. Turns out this was a very inspired
decision. We were told by a contact to go to DEFA a few days
later. After some haphazard queueing and loitering round, more than
six hours in total, we finally managed to get our passports back. It
had taken more than six weeks since we first asked about it till we
got our passports back, and it was one of the fastest VISA renewals on
record. We were extremely happy to see our passports safe and sound,
but, in the happiness of the moment, I had forgotten to check DEFA's
work. Shahin however, being the usual stickler for perfection, did
check it and she was not at all happy about it. The dates on the VISA
were wrong, by precisely one day. They had given us thirty days from
the date we requested the renewal, not the date of the last VISA. This
would make perfect sense if there was an organised department to tell
you the exact rules for the renewal process and to discuss things with
you, things like whether the date of your flight out was compatible
with the VISA expiration date or not. This being Angola, there is
obviously no such thing - you're expected to know it all. If you
didn't, well, that's your problem. We contemplated going back to DEFA
and complaining, but after all the trouble we had renewing the VISA -
and after being told a few times that we were extremely lucky for the
fast speed at which things were happening - well, it just seemed
obvious we had to avoid these people at all costs. The only other
alternative was to change the outgoing flights, a much more feasible
alternative.
</p>

<p>
It was at this point when we finally understood why everyone hates the
rains so much.
</p>

<p>
When we went to TAAG (the Angolan Airlines) we were told that the
computer systems were down, so there wasn't anything they could
do. What they failed to tell us, and we found out later on, was that
the systems had been down for the best part of a week, with no relief
in sight. We spent the entire day waiting, but the system never
returned. Unfortunately, the following day was a bank holiday,
Luanda's 431st birthday, so everything was closed. Friday became the
D-Day.
</p>

<p>
The day started with an early trip to TAAG, but the systems were still
down. Still praying that this was some kind of a temporary blip,
something that would get fixed during the day, we decided to walk down
the road to Western Union to get some money out. Unfortunately, their
systems were down too. Whilst we waited at a local cafe, re-hydrating
ourselves, Shahin managed to somehow swallow a fly. A dirty, Luandan
fly. The whole scene was out of a sitcom, except it really
happened. Fortunately, she didn't even puke. We laughed so much that
we were stared at by all who were in the cafe as we had streams of
tears rolling down our faces.
</p>

<p>
We returned to Western Union, but the systems were still down, so we
decided to go back to TAAG. The systems were not working there either,
and time was fast running out but there just wasn't anything we could
do so we went for lunch at Nando's. On our return to Western Union,
the queue had doubled in size since we last came, but the good news
was that the system was back up. Whilst in the queue I met Joao Solha,
a mate from high-school I hadn't seen in years. After the usual hugs
and reminisces, Joao told us that Western Union had been down for more
than a week, and he was fast running out of money. Today things were
pretty desperate. While we were chatting, news filtered out that the
system was back up, for the great relief of the massive crowds sitting
outside the bank. However, it was almost three o'clock - the usual
closing time - and there were tonnes of people waiting to be seen. The
system could go down at any time, Joao guaranteed us, like it had
happened earlier on in the week. It was up for an hour or two, but it
went down and hadn't returned since then. As we queued up and chatted,
we noticed that the queue wasn't actually moving. Shahin went on a
scouting mission and found out that the ordered queue we had joined in
an hour ago had now evolved to the dreaded Angolan queue. Angolan
queues are the worst type of queues. They basically grow from the
sides. For the more technically oriented, its a mix between a LIFO
(Last In First Out) and a Priority Queue - the priority algorithm
being how well you know the security guard at the door or the people
in front of you. We all got a bit upset with all this, Shahin in
particular, and decided to take action and join the front via the
sides too. Everybody else was doing it too, so when in Rome&#x2026; This
went on for a while, with lots of pushing and shoving and shouting,
until the security guard decided he had had enough:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"Either you start forming a real queue, or no one gets in!!".</li>
</ul>

<p>
We had been in many Angolan queues before and heard the same thing
before too, so we knew nothing - not a thing - would change,
regardless of the best intentions of the security chap. And so it was
this time too. All the people closer to the wall started shouting that
there was a real queue indeed, there had been one all along and they
were in it - which was true for the most part, but not entirely. The
new joiners in the middle of the sidewalk also started shouting,
claiming they were the real queue and always had been, and that there
was no need for further organisation. The shouting match went on for a
bit, with some people starting to get really agitated - including
Shahin - up to a point where the security guard had enough. You have
to put things in perspective. This was a Friday, after a week long
without any access to money. Everyone was really desperate. To this
environment, a keg of powder waiting to ignite, the security guard
decides to shout:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"OK, I've had enough! You're not willing to organise this mess?! I
don't care! You can all get in!"</li>
</ul>

<p>
There was a second or two of silence, the quiet before the storm. What
followed was one of the worse stampedes I've seen in my life, much
worse than the previous one in the same location a few weeks ago. The
really narrow door got attacked simultaneously by all sides with
untamed force. I don't know how the metal frame and the glass survived
it. Shahin was well in the thick of it, pushing, shouting,
waving. Apparently - I wasn't close enough to the front to see this -
there was a skinny lady that managed to get stuck to the door, and
everyone was going past her. Shahin had to push her into the branch,
probably saving her life. It was like a gold rush, except the money we
were getting was actually ours to start off with. Once the confusion
settled and everyone made their way in, we were told by the bank staff
that there was no reason to fear: everyone inside the branch was going
to get their turn - and here's the key part - provided the system was
up. We put the forms into the in-tray and prayed. The Gods must have
pitied us since about two hours later it was our turn, and we managed
to get our money. We heard later that Joao also managed to finally
access his cash, although he ended up taking a five hour lunch break
to get it. Once we had the cash in our hands, we ran back from Mutamba
to TAAG, all the while hoping that their system was working too and
didn't crash in the mean time. TAAG was in full effect when we got
there, a pretty agitated place, a rave party of a travel
agency. Somehow, I don't know how really, we managed to get a ticket
that was fairly close to the front of the queue. Half-an-hour later we
were seen by the attendant. After the usual moaning and feet-dragging,
the I'm-not-really-supposed-to-be-doing-this part, she actually
managed to change the ticket to one day before our VISA expiration.
</p>

<p>
This was one of the most tiring days we've ever experienced. When we
got back home we were simultaneously high, from the success, but also
really low from the tiredness. We had woken up at 7 o'clock to get to
TAAG and got back home more than twelve hours later, exhausted.
</p>
</div>

<h3 id="orgf92fc44">The road to Namibe - or should I say Lubango</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf92fc44">
<p>
All the exhaustion and stress had some really negative
consequences. Shahin suddenly got a fever, very similar to the one I
had experienced before. We did the usual tests at the usual doctors
who, as usual, tried to help themselves of our hard earned cash - but
this time they even suggested having a 50 USD X-ray when Shahin said
she had a bit of a cough. That was the straw that broke the camel's
back. Even I, the least money conscious person in the whole world, had
just about enough of their daylight robbery. We decided to do a bit of
mix-and-match with the exams, play doctors if you'd like, and choose
for ourselves which exams she really needed to do. This had the
desired effect, because the doctor didn't shout at us went we went
back in to the room. We even had to ask him about three or for times
how to read the results, jumping on him in the hospital corridors, and
he must have felt sorry for us since he did explain it, somewhat. In
the end, it seemed like Shahin also had malaria, although not as
severe as mine. We bought the medication and followed the
treatment. However, we were now desperate to leave Luanda again and
this meant no rest for the wicked.
</p>

<p>
We made our way to the airport on the day of the next available
flight - as usual not reserving the tickets beforehand. Shahin was
pretty exhausted and ill-looking, a very worrying situation. Our
contact at the airport was going to sort it all out. We got there
early enough, ten o'clock in the morning, but Luanda's domestic
airport proved to be a lot more confusing than the international
one. Our contact told us that there shouldn't be any problems, all we
had to do is wait around to buy the ticket and then for check-in. So
we waited. An hour went by. Shahin progressively got worse, getting
warmer. Another half-hour went by. At this point, I heard through the
speaker's system - yes, they do seem to have one - something along the
lines of "Namibe's flight has been cancelled!". I couldn't hear
properly, and the warning wasn't issued that many times so we couldn't
tell for sure. If the flight had indeed been cancelled we would have
to get a cab back home and try again in a couple of days. That meant
two days less of holidays outside of Luanda, and two more days of pain
in the middle of the capital's confusion. The only other alternative
was to get a flight - any flight - to another province and make our
way to Namibe overland. This is less of a crazy idea than it sounds,
and people actually do it quite frequently due to the unpredictable
nature of Angolan flights. I mentioned this to our contact, who I had
to keep chasing for information, and he said he could get us to
Lubango - provided we were ready NOW. As in, right now, run to the
check-in desk. This with Shahin dying by my side, feverish. I did as
much of the running as I could, but it was unavoidable, she had to do
some running around too. Somehow we managed to buy the tickets (this
time we had real tickets), check-in, find the right waiting lounge,
get on the bus and board the plane. It was really exhausting. Shahin
was holding on just about, so much so that the flight attendant asked
me if she was alright, a worried look on her face. The flight wasn't
particularly long, and we soon got to Lubango. There, we were told by
Rosa that, by some huge, not yet explained coincidence, a cousin of
ours was also getting to Lubango within the next few minutes and would
be driving to Namibe soon after. Another cartoon moment. After some
waiting, during which Shahin's state improved dramatically, we finally
met cousin Chico. He told us he'd be making his way in an hour or two,
but in the mean time we had to find our own way into town centre and
wait there for him. Fortunately for us, the people near the airport
were extremely nice. Not only did they make sure we got in the right
taxi, but they also kept their cafe open for Shahin while I was busy
hunting Chico down at the airport. We finally got into a taxi, but
this was a fixed route cab which didn't actually go all the way to
town. The young taxi driver took a liking to our English, having
studied in Namibia himself, and after chatting to us for a little
while he decided to take us to our destination for free. Not only
that, he even gave us a mini-tour of town, showing us the cheap
hostels and everything. We ended up giving him some 800 kwanzas, money
he reluctantly accepted. He dropped us off at the Grand Hotel, in one
of Lubango's main arteries.
</p>

<p>
Lubango is the capital of the Huila province. It seems like a really
nice town, and we really would have wanted to stay for a few days
there, but since Rosa had already arranged for our transfer and since
Shahin wasn't feeling that great still, we thought best to go to
Namibe and return when possible. Lubango was once an important
agricultural centre, and also had a few key factories such as
Coca-Cola and Cuca, one of the Angolan beers. It still is a fairly
important place, Angola's city with the highest number of Portuguese
people. These two factories are alive and well, as is the cattle
industry. The national university has a couple of campuses there. Its
a big city as far as these things go, about the same size of Benguela,
if not bigger, and seems like a pretty lively place. Because its
further into the interior, Lubango is very green and lush. To our
great regret, we never did manage to return there.
</p>

<p>
Our stay in Lubango was cut short by Chico's arrival at the hotel in
his massive jeep. He then drove us to Namibe, down Serra da
Leba. These mountains are well known to all Angolans, even to those in
the diaspora that never set foot in the country, because all parents
mention it whenever they reminisce about the land. When you're there
you can easily understand why. The mountains are huge,
magnificent. The drive is extremely impressive, and it even has
waterfalls in the background. On the way up, leaving town, one can see
the whole of Lubango from high above. Then, for a few kilometres one
traverses a plateau, with quite a few farms. After that, the descend
of Serra da Leba begins. It really is an amazing trip, a must do. As
one descends and reaches flatland again, the scenery becomes less and
less green, until one reaches the desert proper. The scenery then
looks like Namibia. Its a huge change, but its done really gradually
over hundreds of kilometres. In less than three hours we were in
Namibe, standing at my cousin's Milucha doorstep.
</p>

<p>
One honourable mention goes to the roads that link Lubango to
Namibe. These are the best roads we saw in the whole of Angola, so
good its impossible to describe in words. There were very few holes in
it, a veritable velvet of a surface.

As we got to Namibe, Shahin's health improved dramatically. Perhaps
some of it has to do with the much less humid climate in Lubango and
Namibe, or with the needed rest we finally got. However, just as we
were celebrating her recovery, I started having a mild fever. It began
on our first outing in Namibe, in which Milucha took us to see town
and then to the nearby city of Tombwa. Late on that day I had a very
high fever. We couldn't manage to get the fever down, even after
taking medicine and having cold water showers. I ended up staying
outdoors in the yard with no t-shirt on, trying to cool down. This
worked for a bit, but eventually the fever came back. It was still
pretty high for most of the next morning so we decided to go to the
doctor. There, very swiftly, the Russian doctor determined I had
paludismo - malaria - again. He also took the time to explain which
exams we needed to figure out if we have malaria - Gota Espessa and
Hemograma - and explained that these exams are not affected by
profilaxia at all. He expressed the same extreme dislike for
profilaxia as every other doctor has in Angola. All and all, not only
was the service a lot better in Namibe, but the prices were more
reasonable. We spent around 50 bucks in total, and this includes the
doctor's time, all the medicine he prescribed and the nurse's time
too. Why would you need a nurse? Well, since my fever didn't want to
came down, the doctor determined I needed diperona
injections. Diperona is normally taken like paracetamol, in pill form,
and very much like it its used to bring the fever down. It is also
available in liquid form, for the more severe cases, but this requires
injecting it into the patient. To be more precise, into the patient's
bum. Not only did I have to be subjected to this humiliation, but it
also hurt like taking back teeth out without anaesthetics. To make
matters worse, diperona was mixed with something else, some kind of
anti-allergenic drug, and the end result was it knocked me out,
hard. After an injection, all I could muster was to get home groggy,
find my bed and sleep. The doctor wanted me to take these injections
for 3 days, twice a day, but we were keen on getting off of it as soon
as possible. In the end, I had three injections, by which time my body
temperature was normal. My bum, however, never quite recovered from
it, and I still walk funny. Around four days later I felt a lot better
and was well enough to start leaving the house - that is, for reasons
other than going to the clinic for injections. And so it was that our
one week stay in Namibe was taken mostly by paludismo.

Namibe is actually quite a nice town, and it is a fairly emotional
place for me since most of my family comes from here. It is situated
at the edge of the desert, and once upon a time it was Angola's
fishing district. It was also responsible for producing most of
Angola's olives. Nowadays, most employment in the province is still
fishing related, and many fisheries still function, but they are a bit
crippled. The government is trying to reform the industry, but its a
slow process.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, unlike Benguela, the candongueiro network is not
particularly efficient in Namibe. For instance, you can't go to the
nearby beaches without personal transportation. We were lucky that
Milucha was actually on holidays, and was willing to spend her time
showing us round. Even though we didn't have as much time as we would
have liked, we still got to see most of the city, including places
like my mom's primary and high-school, and my grandad's old house. It
was an incredible experience. We even had time to meet up with Lau and
Leonor, up from Luanda for the long weekend, also visiting relatives.
</p>

<p>
It was great to see the level of recent development in the
province. Most roads have been tarmacked recently, and there a few new
hospitals and schools, including a campus of the state
university. Clinics work really well, as we found out. There is also
some social housing. As the locals reminded us, there is still lots of
work to be done - for instance, electricity and water are still
haphazard - but, for such a small district, it sure seems to have
managed to get their act together.

After a week in Namibe, we returned to Luanda.

Our last few days in Angola went by pretty quickly. We just had enough
time to say goodbye to people and rest a bit. We had a goodbye dinner
at Chicala's Chinese restaurant, by now our favourite for both the
quality of the food and the price. We were hoping to get a nice crowd,
including Ica and the wife and Rui Murthala and his
woman. Unfortunately, everyone seemed to be tied up. The old faithfuls
Rosa as well as Lau and Leonor did not let us down. It was a great
dinner. Lau offered to take us early in the morning to the airport,
which was great since Macon taxi's were found to be a bit unreliable
on early pickups. We were still a bit concerned, worried that somehow
TAAG would mess-up the tickets and make us stay for an extra day,
getting into VISA problems. Nothing of the kind happened in the
end. Things went really smoothly and we even got to try the new
Boeings TAAG has bought, with multimedia players on each individual
desk. A few hours later we were back in Joburg.
