Assorted list of stuff on the web I found that looks interesting, so
that I don't forget about it. If I have had time to parse it, it also
has some minor commentary as to why I found it interesting.

* Emacs

Anything of interest on the subject of my favourite editor, Emacs.

** Configs

User configurations with stuff I want to copy.

- [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d][redguardtoo' emacs.d]]: "A fast and robust Emacs setup"
- [[https://github.com/skeeto/.emacs.d][skeeto's .emacs.d]]: "My Personal Emacs Configuration"
- [[https://github.com/caisah/emacs.dz][caisah's emacs.dz]]: "A list of people with nice emacs config files"

** Authoring

- [[https://github.com/emacs-love/weblorg][weblorg]]: "A Static HTML Generator entirely written in
  Emacs-Lisp". Not actually using it at present, but it does seem to
  make the whole authoring process much easier.

** Email

- [[https://muto.ca/posts/actually-using-emacs-rmail.html][Actually Using Emacs Rmail]]: blog post on how to setup rmail.

** Toolbar

** Interesting modes

- [[https://gitlab.com/howardabrams/emacs-piper][emacs-piper]]: "Wrapper around existing Emacs functionality that
  creates an interactive user interface to dealing with unstructured
  textual data similar with how we transform data through pipes in the
  shell."
- [[https://github.com/nobiot/org-transclusion][org-transclusion:]] "Transclusion is the ability to include content
  from one file into another by reference."

** People

Blogs and other material from Emacs users.

- [[https://two-wrongs.com/][Two Wrongs]]: blog created using Emacs tools with lots of posts on
  emacs.

* Audiobooks

  appear to solve all our problems.
