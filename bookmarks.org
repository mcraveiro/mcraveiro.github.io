Assorted list of stuff on the web I found that looks interesting, so
that I don't forget about it. If I have had time to parse it, it also
has some minor commentary as to why I found it interesting.

* Emacs

Anything of interest on the subject of my favourite editor, Emacs.

** Configs

User configurations with stuff I want to copy.

- [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d][redguardtoo' emacs.d]]: "A fast and robust Emacs setup"

** Authoring

- [[https://github.com/emacs-love/weblorg][weblorg]]: "A Static HTML Generator entirely written in
  Emacs-Lisp". Not actually using it at present, but it does seem to
  make the whole authoring process much easier.

** Email

  appear to solve all our problems.
