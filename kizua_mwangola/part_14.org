After a prolonged stay here at Nancy's, Peter decided to move to Hotel
Praia Morena. We were all getting quite used to him (and to Mark too,
another recent defector), but that's the gist of a guest house I
guess - people come and people go. But that's not the story; the story
is _how_ he got there.

Like any practical South-African-come-Irish-come-German he thought the
fastest way to move hotels was to take a kupapata (a
bike-taxi). However, he had some luggage, so he decided to go for a
kupapata with a trailer - something fairly common around here. He
immediately caused chaos amongst all the staff by asking them to
arrange one for him: surely not!! A Praia Morena guest riding on the
back of the kupapata with the luggage?! Unheard off! Debates
immediately started, and heated discussions too; people wanted to see
this crazy foreigner riding with the luggage. I was even asked to take
a picture, an undeniable proof that this event had actually happened.

No one believed the security guards would allow them to park at the
entrance of the hotel. In the end, the mission was successful. Whilst
the locals were getting agitated, the foreigners didn't quite
understand what the fuss was all about - seemed like the sensible
thing to do, really. I guess they don't quite get the "never lose your
style" moto.
