* OMG, Ghana!!

Thursday, January 28, 2010

Unbelievable. Watching Ghana v Nigeria was exactly like watching
Angola v Ghana. One attack from Ghana early on in which they score,
then 90-odd minutes of Nigeria attacking badly. Amazing, like a carbon
copy. Off to the stadium now, to watch Egypt v Algeria. Hopefully my

either way, I think Ghana is running out of luck, fast.

* Magreb War

Friday, January 29, 2010

There is no other way to describe yesterday's game --- it was like being
invited to watch someone else's war. A few days ago I overheard one of
the reporters quoting a Algerian player, his words being along the
lines of "this is a matter of life or death" and "it will be a
war". Well, it really was. To make matters worse, the game boasted the
biggest crowd of away fans we've ever seen in CAN, with a predominance
for the Algerian side. The rumours of two thousand Algerian fans
entering the country were certainly an exaggeration, but at least five
hundred must have done the trek, and they were noisy too.

There was a lot at stake, and it wasn't just the place in the
final. The Egyptians wanted revenge from Sudan, which according to
them was solely due to the referee's mistakes. The Algerians wanted to
prove that Sudan was no mistake, and that they deserved to represent
the Magreb and the whole Arab world in the World Cup. If, to that, you
add years of bad blood between these two, you're starting to get a
rough idea of how high the tension was.

When it came to football, however, the Algerians demonstrated their
Achilles heel: bad behaviour. To be fair, this is a common problem on
all Arab teams. We've seen Egypt and Tunisia losing it too, moaning on
every decision referees take against them and ganging up around the
ref. Algeria managed to go that extra step, causing total havoc when
Egypt got a penalty. The game was going Egypt's way, to be sure, but
it wasn't clear cut; but playing Egypt is always a difficult task, and
playing with ten men is neigh impossible. From then on it was a
slippery slope, red cards following red cards and trivial goals
following trivial goals. Egypt wasn't even trying to score, but the
massive gaps in the Algerian defence made it so easy they couldn't
resist. The final body count revealed almost as many red cards as
goals (three of the former against four of the latter). It seems Egypt
is, and always was, the champion waiting to be crowned.

As a side note, I was extremely surprised to see a packed ground for
this game --- must have been around thirty thousand of us watching
it. Most people here are interested in the Southern African teams, and
very few can name an Arab player other than Egypt's Zidane. However,
Benguela turned up for the game in great numbers and made loads of
noise. A good few hours later, I'm still unable to hear properly. I
guess Egypt became our adoptive team, the only one that never left
Benguela all the way up to the final. Egypt's coach said so in the
after match press conference, and thanked the Benguelans for all the
support.

This was also a milestone for us: the last game of the competition
we're watching live. We've seen many games, travelled to three of the
four CAN stadiums, saw Angola live and met many, many great people. It
was a great adventure. But all good things must come to an end,
unfortunately, and the tiredness is now getting to us. The last two
games will be watched on telly.

* They think it's all over...

Sunday, January 31, 2010

And it's all over now: Egypt has won the CAN. Ghana did a lot better
than I expected though, and in the end the game was actually quite
close. The cup goes to the best team though. The other point worth of
notice was the size of the crowd: over forty thousand Angolans turned
up to watch it, an amazing figure for a final that did not involve the
host nation.
