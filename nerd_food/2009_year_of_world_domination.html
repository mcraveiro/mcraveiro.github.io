<h2 id="orgdefd8f1">World Domination Revisited</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdefd8f1">
<p>
It's hard to believe, but it has been almost two years since I ranted
on World Domination. Two years have rolled by, and it seems
appropriate to resume the theme, but from a slightly different angle.
</p>

<p>
So, lets cut to the chase. Will 2009 be the Year of the Linux Desktop?
The short answer is no, and I think its now clear it will apply to
2010, 2011 and so on. In fact, in 2009 we won't even meet the looser
definition of World Domination I proposed, although we're getting
closer.
</p>

<p>
What has happened since 2007? Well, we became a lot more popular in
the desktop segment, in particular on the whole new category of MIDs
and netbooks; at one point we entirely dominated it, but over time
normal computing trends reasserted themselves. According to the latest
figures, Linux now ships on around 10-15% of new netbooks, as opposed
to the incredible 100% we had in the beginning. Netbooks had the
highest visibility, but, to be fair, some inroads were made on all
usual areas including server and regular desktop markets. Good, but
nothing jaw dropping.
</p>

<p>
So we find ourselves, two years later, asking ourselves the age old
questions. Why haven't we seen at least one significant large
migration? Why didn't one of the multinational companies punt on a
100K RedHat or Novell desktop migration?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb1835b4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb1835b4">A Maturing Industry</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb1835b4">
<p>
For those who, like me, have been using Linux for over a decade, there
always has been a lingering feeling, an idea on the back of one's mind
insisting that one day the world would suddenly get it: the herd would
finally see the light and the big mass migration would
begin. Microsoft's time would come to an end, just as the once
unassailable empires of IBM and DEC eventually faded. But time has
gone by, the public has been exposed to Free Software, and yet no
major visible changes have occurred. On the plus side, all these years
of waiting gave us plenty of data points to calibrate our
understanding of the software industry. Perhaps now we can begin to
build a model that explains why things turned out the way they did.
</p>

<p>
Looking back, one of the key things one cannot fail to notice is how
the world has changed in the last twenty years. The world in which I
was brought up was a world of fast paced change, of great volatility:
companies sprung from nowhere, dominated the market and then
disappeared as if they never existed. Sinclair'sZX Spectrum,
Commodore's C-64 and Amiga, Tandy's machines and so many other brands
came and went, all in the blink of an eye. Those were heady times. It
happened during so long a period that one started to believe this was
the way of the world: a superior product immediately bought by a
significant critical mass of consumers, only to be dumped as soon as a
new leader emerged.
</p>

<p>
But the computer world was small then, and it belonged mainly to
geeks. The homebrew generation had receded into the shade a bit, to be
sure, and mass production took over; things got easier for
users. However, the target market was still tiny, and still mainly
composed of dedicated people willing to put in the hours to get things
to work.
</p>

<p>
Non-geeks &#x2014; particularly suits &#x2014; viewed the wild west mentality of
the technology sector in a completely different light. For them, it
was a serious problem. The technology was promising and the killer
applications were beginning to appear, but caution ruled the
day. After all, one could invest a considerable amount of money on
hardware and software, make a glorious 3 year plan with all bells and
whistles, only to find out that the vendors had folded, or gave up on
the products entirely. This was no way to run a business.
</p>

<p>
Microsoft saw it clearly and responded by talking the language
business wanted to hear. It was time for "workgroups" and "solutions",
for "office" and "enterprise". Windows 3.11 was a great step on that
direction but, SWAGing somewhat, I'd say Windows 95 was the
cornerstone. It marked the end of the wild frontier days, and signaled
the consolidation of the new world order. Microsoft's strategies, much
like those of a Machiavellian prince, were focused on stabilisation
through domination. It was nasty, but extremely effective. Their
dominance achieved what business most wanted, which was predictability
and standardisation. Here was, finally, a solid ground on which to
plan.
</p>

<p>
The result was explosive. Microsoft went from a small vendor in a
highly competitive market to the dominant force. By creating
standards &#x2014; however closed one may consider them to be &#x2014; the
company helped expand exponentially the overall size of the market,
and developed a vital symbiosis with business. Each release of Windows
provided both stability (through flawless backwards compatibility) and
a dazzling number of new features; and each release was delivered at a
rate which fit nicely with business' need for planning.
</p>

<p>
And so the world went, in this nice happy fashion, from Windows 95 to
Windows 98, NT 3.5, to NT 4, Windows 2000 to Windows XP. What
Microsoft managed to achieve between Windows 95 and XP was
ubiquity. Suddenly everyone everywhere was using Windows and Office,
and the numbers were huge. Immense. The geeks were finally,
completely, totally, utterly dwarfed by the non-geeks.
</p>

<p>
XP was a landmark release in more ways than one, though. It is with XP
that we meet our second inflection point, at which the symbiosis
between Microsoft and business started to breakdown. Until XP business
never really questioned the upgrade cycle: hardware grew so much
faster from one year to the next that it made perfect sense to upgrade
machines regularly. Software in itself also suffered dramatic
improvements from release to release, benefiting those who kept up
with the times. Being at the cusp of the wave was a competitive
advantage.
</p>

<p>
But with XP, strange things begun to happen:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Moore's law hit a social barrier; suddenly people stopped wanting
the fastest PCs and started looking instead for other things such as
peripherals, bigger and better monitors, etc. And much more
importantly, low end PCs became good enough for the vast majority of
tasks.</li>
<li>Microsoft's products went from being seen as the cheap alternative
to expensive brands, to the expensive brand with no real
alternatives. The operative system cost became a significant part of
the overall PC cost.</li>
<li>Upgrade fatigue kicked in, and many companies begun to ask just
exactly why there was a need to change the entire estate so
frequently.</li>
<li>The size of the PC market became so large that it just wasn't
feasible for a large part of it to quickly upgrade as it had
happened in the past.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In short, the PC market started showing signs of maturity. Microsoft's
objective &#x2014; their attempt to stabilise and standardise the PC market
&#x2014; had been achieved; but at the same time, its success may have
brought about great difficulties for the company. Seen in this light,
Vista's problems are not so much technical. There may be a number of
significant issues with the operative system &#x2014; although most Windows
users I regularly speak to seem to be pretty happy with it. It has its
rough edges, but so did XP in the beginning and Windows 95 before it,
and that didn't stop them from being huge successes.
</p>

<p>
What has changed fundamentally is the relationship between Microsoft
and its user base. There just isn't any need for mass upgrades any
more, and the more constrained IT budgets get, the more obvious this
becomes. After all, Vista was extremely successful on the new PC
segment; it struggled more when trying to convince existing PC owners
to upgrade. I am strongly convinced that Windows 7 will suffer the
same fate. The crucial element on its adoption is going to be the End
Of Life of XP, because no business will want to run a product that is
no longer supported by its creator. When EOL is declared for XP , all
business will start to migrate to Windows 7 &#x2014; but not before
then. They are more than happy with it; it works, it's well supported
and more importantly, "they know how it behaves". The learning curve
will start from scratch, be it Vista or Windows 7, and, from a
commercial perspective, for no particularly good reason.
</p>

<p>
In truth, business need only a platform that is:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>good enough (in which case they won't change)</li>
<li>compellingly better (in which case they will want to change)</li>
<li>compellingly cheaper (in which case they will be made to change by
external pressures)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Its becoming harder and harder to create software that is so
compellingly better that would make users upgrade. And Microsoft
cannot start a cannibalisation strategy based on price, because its
business model is based on the notion that products become
progressively more expensive (after all their R&amp;D costs increase
dramatically from release to release, in the illusive search for
killer features). The only weapon left to the company is to force
customers to upgrade by whatever other means available &#x2014; such
asEOLing products. This can only be done for so long until business
wises up.
</p>

<p>
It is in the midst of this carnage that Mac and Free Software products
are competing. In view of this, one can conclude that no one &#x2014;
Microsoft included &#x2014; will have an easy ride convincing large numbers
of existing users, business or home, to switch. The real fight for
change is going to happen on the fringes of the PC market, the beaches
where those new machines are being sold.
</p>

<p>
Here, there are two weapons available to Free Software: technological
superiority and price.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgfc66e02" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgfc66e02">Competing on Technological Superiority and Price</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfc66e02">
<p>
A lot of nerds, to some extent myself included, are convinced that
Linux is technologically superior to Windows. In short, UNIX is
elegant and Windows is a kludge. The mystery is why no one else seems
to see this. However, when one delves a bit further, there are several
problems with the current state of Linux, and all of them are related
to the ninety-ninety rule.
</p>

<p>
The crucial difference between the business oriented approach taken by
Microsoft and other software vendors is this: its best to have
something that works somewhat now than something that works perfectly
in a few years time. With this in mind, one can spot many, many things
were developed on Windows with an almost exclusive focus on
time-to-deliver. Microsoft's engineers didn't spend months looking at
X-Windows to implement a GUI, nor did they worry aboutremoting until
they were forced to, or with shell scripting; the list goes on and
on. Now contrast that with Linux:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>D-Bus was years in the making, and its only now we're seeing a
significant adoption at the application level, with many exported
interfaces;</li>
<li>GStreamer was years in the making, and its only now we're seeing
stability at the codec level, good support for most popular formats;</li>
<li>PulseAudio has been years in the making and we're still experiencing
loss of sound, problems with proprietary applications, etc.;</li>
<li>XFree and X.Org have been years in the making and we still have
problems with some drivers, a flickering startup on boot and on user
switch;</li>
</ul>

<p>
The list goes on and on. From a user perspective, it matters not that
PulseAudio (to pick but one victim) is architecturally extremely well
designed and copes with an horrendously complex problem domain, made
all the more complex due to the zoo of sound solutions in Linux. What
matters is that he or she cannot useSkype to talk to their friends
because it doesn't work. Or it may work, but the instructions are so
complex that no sane non-geek could follow. Or that using Flash causes
the web browser to crash.
</p>

<p>
In general, I think it's fair to say that in places were there was
enough time to think, design, implement and stabilise a solution, Free
Software projects did a much better job than Windows; take packaging
at the distribution level for example and compare that with the amount
of clicks required to keep all windows applications
up-to-date. However, due to the very nature of Free Software
development, solutions have a tendency to take a lot longer to reach
stability. This is a good thing, because when they mature, they are
truly technical achievements.
</p>

<p>
For example, it would have been easy to slot X.Org into the kernel,
much like Windows did in the past to achieve better performance. Not
so in Linux. The long path was taken, painstakingly working out which
bits of code really needed to be in the kernel, and which should live
in X land. The end result,KMS, is amazing, and will have large amounts
of side-benefits &#x2014; like most changes in Free Software tend to
have. But even when all KMS code has been merged, we will still have
to wait for the binary drivers to pick up these changes, so it may be
quite some time until end users see any benefits.SELinux is also
another example. Implementing the infrastructure and changing the
kernel was in itself hard; but the real toil is now being done
byRedHat and the community, spending many painstaking hours going
through applications and creating the appropriate policies. Only then
will SELinux really shine.
</p>

<p>
So, whilst I don't think, from a user perspective, that we are
superior to Windows at present, I do think that in the near future
(three years) we will be. What's more, we now have a platform for
growth and its really easy to bring companies on board. For example,
just look at dropbox and their Nautilus integration.
</p>

<p>
The Linux desktop of the future will be so uber cool its impossible to
describe. Insanely fast boots, fantastic graphical support with no
flickering from boot to desktop or on user switching, great
integration between apps courtesy of D-Bus, all sorts of weird and
wonderful sound capabilities courtesy ofPulseAudio, Telepathy for
presence, great UI in Gnome and KDE. And all because each developer
chose to take the long and hard path rather than the easy way out.
</p>

<p>
That being said, we have to live in the present, and we are still at
the point of paying the cost. Soon the second 90% will be done.
</p>

<p>
The last topic I'd like to discuss is price. If there is something
Microsoft cannot compete on with Free Software, its on price. After
all, one can't really go much lower than zero. However, it's important
to notice that when it comes to business, cost is a tricky thing. So
much of it comes down to perception. After all, one could argue
successfully that user retraining is required to move from Windows to
Linux. This would dramatically increase the costs, making such a move
prohibitively expensive. On the same token, one could look at the
example of people such as Dave Largo, and conclude that Linux can be
easily adopted by end users with very little training, requires little
hardware and is infinitely configurable with little effort.
</p>

<p>
In truth, cost will never be an easy proposition for Linux until
technical superiority is attained. On the server side, the battle was
not "won" because Linux was free but because the solutions being
offered were technically superior, integrated well with Windows and
were being priced at a significant discount of a Windows
equivalent. Only then did price become significant. Something similar
needs to happen to the desktop market.

I hope I succeeded in demonstrating that there will never be a Year of
the Linux Desktop as such, but instead, one should expect the
continuation of present trends: a sequence of years with slow and
steady gains being made. Maturity changed the rules of the game
somewhat.

<p>
If we had the current Linux desktop a decade or so ago, when the
market was younger and more fragmented, we would probably take on a
significant share of the market, even competing againstXP . But things
changed, and there is a lot more inertia everywhere. With regards to
the battle for new computers, the key factor there will be
technological superiority. Linux will stand a good chance of fighting
for that market in the next three years, once all the core
infrastructure stabilises.
