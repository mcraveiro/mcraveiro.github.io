<p>
There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about
and the ones nobody uses. &#x2014; Bjarne Stroustrup
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
Sunday, April 21, 2013
</p>

<p>
I think most C++ developers would agree that there has never been a
better time to be a C++ developer than the present: after all, the C++
11 standard was released adding a slew of modern features to the
language and we are now seeing clang and gcc nearing 100% feature
completion. In addition, there is an amount of activity around the
language and libraries that I don't ever recall seeing in my
professional career; the C++ 14 papers give a pretty good idea of the
diversity and reach of this work.
</p>

<p>
In effect, C++ is negotiating the transition from a closed, vendor
driven platform to an open, community driven project. These two
articles will attempt to narrate the process, from the perspective of
a long time C++ user.
</p>

<p>
From the beginning, Stroustrup had always believed that without
libraries C++ would be a pretty useless language:
</p>

<p>
Without a good library, most interesting tasks are hard to do in C++;
but given a good library, almost any task can be made easy.
</p>

<p>
Plain C++ was a pretty useless language: many developers reinvented
the wheel, and libraries of poor quality were endlessly rewritten. Its
hard to remember now, but in the nineties it was a rite of passage to
write your own containers such as doubly-linked lists. Slashdot user
VortexCortex gives a pretty insightful picture of those long forgotten
days:
</p>

<p>
Well, I wrote my own Hash Map implementation. Before that I had my own
Linked Lists too. Before C++ came along I even maintained my own OOP
implementation in C with a spiffy pre-processor to convert syntactic
sugar into the equivalent ugly object oriented C code riddled with
namespace prefixes, indecipherable pointer math for dynamic (virtual)
functions (actions), and statically complied variable (property)
look-up tables for run-time type inspection (reflection).
</p>

<p>
It led to incompatibilities between codebases – My Entities+C wouldn't
be compatible with your C+OOP. Hell, we didn't even use the same
terminology, or necessarily even support the same feature sets. The
point is, I wasn't the only one who was doing that (see also:
Objective C). There were lots of us, it was a huge waste of duplicated
effort. So many, in fact, that C++ was born, and the STL too […].
</p>

<p>
It is in this context that the C++ 98 standard emerged, and it was
seen as a major victory for all involved &#x2014;a milestone in the
development of the language. However, pragmatism won the day and
parsimony is always a requirement for shipping; the standard library
was pretty much just the STL, the I/O Library and naively-defined
string support. Once one exhausted the core functionality of the
standard library, well, you were on your own. This is were library
vendors came in.
</p>

<p>
C++ had always been a highly profitable tooling market for vendors,
and the vacuum of specification only served to amplify the profits. It
was now possible to make a true claim for vendor independence &#x2014;
"hey we are 100% standards compliant!"  &#x2014;while at the same time
providing large amounts of vendor specific code. Once a vendor was
chosen, vendor lock-in was almost by design: the libraries provided so
much functionality and in such vendor-specific ways that changing
libraries was synonymous to rewriting entire code bases.
</p>

<p>
The other interesting aspect of these days was that C++ community just
didn't know how to write good C++. Most of the vendor libraries coped
out and simply defined object oriented APIs because that was easier to
create and easier to consume. Stepanov's dreams &#x2014;that the STL was
simply one example of many of a different way of thinking, and a raft
of libraries along the same lines were soon to follow &#x2014;were put on
hold.
</p>

<p>
But people were already learning from the success of community driven
languages such as Perl and Python. A man that was ahead of the curve
in this regard was Beman Dawes. Not only did he deeply understand the
standardisation process &#x2014;and its flaws &#x2014;but he also saw that
libraries were the key to success. Thus Boost began as an effort to
provide the missing libraries, in a nimble, community driven way that
at the same time had high quality standards; these were provided by
peer reviews, requests for documentation and so on. Boost soon became
the home for the "fundamental" C++ thinking, in many ways continuing
the discovery process of the Stepanov ideas in libraries such as
Boost.Graph.
</p>

<p>
In the mean time, the world didn't stand still. The rich pickings C++
provided to vendors proved to be their downfall, as the largess of the
tools market gave way to lean times. The crowds moved over to the new
shinny toys such as Java and C#, and the new breed of dynamic
languages gave C++ the final kick into the legacy bucket. It was just
not cool anymore to be seen doing C++. These new languages learned
their lessons and came out of the box with large class libraries that
provided support for all sorts of things, making the standard library
look small and antiquated in comparison. Even with Boost, one would
still be nowhere near the functionality of out-of-the-box Java or C#,
let alone Python or Ruby.
</p>

<p>
When a COBOL-style death appeared certain, a phoenix-like effect
kicked in. Just as it was with UNIX &#x2014;where the death and shrinkage of
UNIX vendors became the catalyst to create a new breed of UNIX based
on collaboration rather than competition &#x2014;so the same happened to
C++. When the big money moved away it was suddenly noticed that no
single company could afford to maintain a large library by themselves
on the skimpy margins they were now making. Thus many companies opted
for open sourcing their code &#x2014;some just before they went out of
business, others as a strategic way of staying in business. Many
vendors died, but the few that remained found healthy niches from
which to run their businesses.
</p>

<p>
The second factor that kept C++ alive after all the cool kids moved on
was that the old school engineers were still around, and when
efficiency became a key concern &#x2014;as it always does in the end &#x2014;they
were there to explain how efficient server side code could be written
in C++. So whilst uncool, C++ was alive and well, just surviving
underground in the guts of data centres and in large scientific
projects. These users were making hefty use of open source, with Linux
GCC and a plethora of open source libraries as their weapons of
choice. Together with the appearance of Clang, this mean that both the
tooling and the libraries in C++ moved forward in leaps and bounds,
but in a process that was almost entirely divorced from the
standard. From not having enough libraries we went to having too many
of them, with lots of overlapping functionality.
</p>

<p>
Whilst this was happening, C++ didn't stand still. Some of the more
obvious Boost code got shipped into TRs and made their way to end
users. And C++ 0x was cooking. This was a major change to the
standard, composed both of core language changes but much more
importantly, of a great deal of additions to the standard library. A
number of Boost libraries were polished up and moved into the std
namespace.
</p>

<p>
But this brought with itself its own problems. Some were related to
the new language features &#x2014;its still not certain how some of these
should be used &#x2014;and others are related to the new libraries. For
those of us heavily reliant on Boost, a difficult problem emerged: the
standard libraries didn't cover all aspects of the Boost libraries
they standardised; for instance, Boost Serialisation won't work with
texttt{std::shared<sub>ptr</sub>}, so now code bases become a mix of Boost and
standard library code. Clearly the process of offloading Boost
libraries to the standard has only begun.
