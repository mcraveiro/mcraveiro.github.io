<p>
We cannot choose one desktop over the other &#x2014; Gnome or KDE &#x2014;
because there's users for both code bases. &#x2013; Miguel de Icaza
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
<i>Circa 1999.</i>
</p>

<p>
There's been enough direct and indirect ranting on desktop
environments over the last few weeks, from articles about how C and
UNIX are not a match made in heaven to discussions on Slashdot that
start with "KDE 2.X is out" and end with complaints on how "Gnome
moves at a pace that is so much slower than KDE". I know people are
getting a bit tired of these sort of flamewars &#x2014; and I apologise
beforehand if what I'm about to say does cover the same ground &#x2014; but
I feel there is a need for some analysis from a user perspective.
</p>

<p>
In particular, I would like to comment on some of the most
controversial aspects of Gnome and give some ideas as to why things
are like they are and where they may end in the future. I know I lack
authority to speak about some matters, but this contribution strikes
me has important since people with more authority seem to lack time or
inclination; and although I am not a Gnome developer, I do use it
since the bug infested days of 0.x and I do follow quite closely our
community. So lets get the ball rolling.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org56b78d6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org56b78d6">Why does KDE move <i>so</i> much faster than Gnome?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org56b78d6">
<p>
There are no easy explanations as to why people perceive Gnome as
being slow, but there are a few factors that might shed some
light. Unfortunately, we have to go and dig a bit, back to those long
forgotten days where licenses were still an issue. Lets make this as
swift and painless as possible.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgeec06f2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgeec06f2">The history issue</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgeec06f2">
<p>
As it is known to all, KDE made a very pragmatic decision when things
were starting off and chose Qt as their toolkit. It was a decision
based purely on technical merit, and on these grounds Qt had no real
competitors. Unfortunately, Qt was not under a free license then (free
as in speech), so this provoked a reaction from the GNU-er side of the
community. Led by Miguel, developers got together and formed the Gnome
project, with the goal of developing a totally free desktop
environment. With time, Qt was re-licenced under the GPL, but by then
it was too late &#x2014; too much effort had already been done.
</p>

<p>
Now, apart from all the nasty things that have been said by both sides
and worldwide trolls, this event marked the future progression of
these two projects. You see, KDE started off with a mature toolkit
that offered many things programmers expect: a) a good, well
documented API b) a lot of abstraction from GCC's problems with C++ c)
a lot of man hours spent in making sure everything was in working
order d) a lot of scope, being more of a framework for application
development than a toolkit.
</p>

<p>
With regards to d), I'm certainly not the right person to talk about
Qt's merits as I have never done any development with it; but a quick
glance at KDevelop shows me that it includes support for containers,
XML, DOM, a socket abstraction, FTP, and a lot more.
</p>

<p>
Also, one should not treat a) lightly. From my knowledge of wxWindows,
Qt appears to be very well designed and quality of its design surely
teaches new developers to try to follow the same practice, especially
with an OO language. And while we're talking about new users, I think
we all agree when I say that documentation by itself is almost
decisive when learning something new (hence why I'm such a big fan of
wxWindows). No one likes to be struggling with the language while at
the same time trying to make sense of third-party libraries.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, things are quite different in our side of the
fence. Whatever the circumstances were when decisions were made, we
have to coldly deal with the present. Gnome folks are more like an
architect who must worry about designing the building while
simultaneously dealing with the production of almost all the materials
he's going to use.
</p>

<p>
As things stand (1.4), we lack maturity in GTK, in some important
Gnome libraries, in most of our applications and in our
documentation. All of this with varying degrees, of course. At this
point I can hear you say "Isn't that like, in everything?"
</p>

<p>
Well, you must bear in mind that there are only so many programmers we
can throw at a problem, especially at the boring ones. Worst, we cant
just stop everything and focus our attention in making the building
blocks because we are not a company. This makes our users and new
developers very confused: why do I need so many libraries to get ZXY
going? Why can't I have the latest X package and the latest Z package
simultaneously? Where's the documentation for XYZ? Why is your file
manager slow? And the answer is normally "we're working on it!".
</p>

<p>
What we must not allow people to believe is that this is the Gnome way
of doing things, that things are like they are on purpose. When they
say "we're working on it!" they're actually working on it, and
there's much to work on at the moment.
</p>

<p>
Gnome people are not bad developers, lazy gits who don't care about
documentation, or schizophrenic people who hate integration and love
having different address books for each of its many mail
applications. Its just that they're juggling with many balls at the
same time and its hard to compete with people that juggle with less
balls. Sometimes you are developing an application and have to stop
and create or improve an entire library before you can go back to what
you were doing. Obviously some of those libraries end up not having
widespread use while some others are seen as The Right Thing (TM). Its
all part of the learning process.
</p>

<p>
And there's no point in saying "if you had started with a more mature
toolkit, you'd be much better off", because when those decisions
where taken the world was a very different place, regardless of which
side you were on at the time, and now nothing can be done about it.
</p>

<p>
But for those that think this is a bleak view of Gnome, it
isn't. There is an extraordinary amount of work being done in a very
short space of time, most of it in things that are not visible to end
users, and the mere fact that people still put Gnome in line with KDE
demonstrates the quality of the work.
</p>

<p>
In fact, Gnome 2.0 will probably be a turning point in terms of
professional-ness, because as time goes by the core gets stable and
the side effect is we have more time on our hands so other things will
get more CPU time and therefore improve; you cant worry about nifty
documentation when the API itself is changing!
</p>

<p>
Alas, when maturity is reached, we can count on our friends at SUN or
IBM to start a professional documentation of all of the API, together
with some nifty examples that will make any newbie a Gnome developer
in no time. They'll be very interested in doing so by then, believe
me. By then we'll also have a couple of nice IDE's to chose from so
things will be much better for people starting.

<div id="outline-container-org53b2cb1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org53b2cb1">The language issue</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org53b2cb1">
<p>
I have to say I am a big C++ fan; its my main language and I
appreciate its elegance. But honestly do not believe the language is
playing too important a role here. Lets think: in a UNIX environment,
how many hackers are experts in C? How many have done it for years,
and are experienced in developing large, complex applications?
</p>

<p>
In fact, if we look at the work of a famous writer in OO theory,
Bertrand Meyer, we can see that many of the things he considers to be
determinant factors in a program are present in many C programs:
robustness, correctness, extensibility, re-usability, compatibility,
efficiency, portability. All of these apply to our beloved kernel &#x2014;
excelling in some &#x2014; and its done in C<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
In terms of re-usability, although you cannot inherit
functionality cleanly in C, it is certainly not the only way to reuse;
at any rate I'd probably consider design reuse more important that
code reuse.
</span>. Influenced by Meyer's
thinking, I too believe OO is more of a way of thinking than it is a
language, although languages can embody a bit of that way of thinking
&#x2014; and some do it more than others. While being designed strictly for
OOP is an important advantage, it cannot be denied that years of
experience produce results that are quite close to it.
</p>

<p>
C++ is a language that requires a lot of experience in OO, a lot of
theory to get the design right and that's why most large free software
projects tend to be rather bad when done in C++ &#x2014; being Abiword,
Mozilla, KDE and its applications some notable exceptions. I believe
there is a very good explanation for these exceptions. All of the
projects share one fact in common, and that is there were some very
experienced C++ hackers that laid out the foundations, making tough
structural decisions at an early stage. For instance, look at
Abiword's source one of these days and you'll see things along the
lines of Design Patterns; the code is absolutely marvellous. That's
not work of a kid in college that is learning as he goes along.
</p>

<p>
More: to get a lot of people to that sort of level you need solid and
proven standards, a good compiler that respects those standards, lots
of time and lots of sample code to learn from. C++ just hasn't been
out in the free software community long enough for us to have many
expert hackers as we have in C. The standards are new (1998, I
believe), the compiler is just out, the sample code is quite daunting
and complex. The successful projects solve some of these problems by
re-inventing a lot of the core functionality of C++ (for example, the
STL is not very popular).
</p>

<p>
Please note that I'm not saying KDE is where it is solely because its
based on Qt; KDE developers have a lot of merit for things like their
own object model, Konqueror, KDevelop, and many, many other
applications that are astonishing accomplishments which cannot be
argued with. But an important part of its structure is inherited from
Qt and that gave them the solid foundations on which to build.
</p>

<p>
My point being, it has little to do with the language and a lot more
to do with maturity. Soon, when GTK reaches a level of maturity
comparable to Qt, we'll see a lot less people saying that C is
dead. There's just far too many good C hackers for that to be the
truth.

<h3 id="org06b3849">Packaging issues</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org06b3849">
<p>
The second issue I think is interesting is the role of Ximian in the
Gnome community. Their merit, knowledge and spirit cannot be argued
with. But unfortunately, having a center of gravity as large as Ximian
is generating some friction. Lets go through some problems we have at
the moment.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5ef7609" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5ef7609">Can the real Gnome please stand up?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5ef7609">
<p>
It is most annoying when you get a Red Hat machine and it starts with
a Red Hat Gnome, and I'm sure most people feel the same way. Red Hat
is sometimes conservative on their tastes &#x2014; so we don't get the most
up to date stuff like we're used to with Ximian (or <i>were</i> used
to&#x2026;); and for those unfortunate enough to live where Dial Up is
king, upgrading is an issue.
</p>

<p>
Besides, even if you do have the latest Gnome packaged by Red Hat, you
may want to install something distributed by Ximian or vice-versa and
although things may work well together, the idea of installing a
package from different distros is daunting. Its almost like installing
a Mandrake RPM in a Red Hat box: its probably scarier if it installs
without any error messages.
</p>

<p>
My view here is that we do not need this duplication of efforts, and I
think it is doing a lot of damage in terms of public image. Just try
to explain this to a newbie: not only there are multiple distros for
the operative system, there are also multiple distros for the desktop
environments!
</p>

<p>
There's also the issue of package selection, or in other words, what
gets included and what doesn't. A KDE standard install includes a lot
more applications than a Ximian Gnome one, and that's not because of
the lack of GTK/Gnome apps. Part of it is possibly to do with
commercial reasons: Ximian wants a stable product, not a mix between
solid and bleeding edge. Or it may be that they don't want to have to
package too many things, instead they prefer to do less and do it
well.
</p>

<p>
Either way this is where things get tricky: if they're the main
packager we're stuck and <i>we</i> represents mainly the Dial Up crowd that
can't spend hours hoping from site to site to get all the libraries
and then get the new apps.
</p>

<p>
So what do we need? I can see some solutions:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We need to stop this packaging nonsense of my Gnome and your
Gnome. We need to have a standard packaging the Gnome core, with all
the libraries needed. That someone should be the distro. So Red Hat
would make RPM's for all the platforms it runs on. This core is
distributed as one package, that you can install or un-install
easily.</li>
<li>This same core offers a set of tools that allow customisation
without rebuilding: change the initial splash screen, change the
menu's, etc. so that a distro can configure it without having to
rebuild it. And that should be the same for all platforms, different
binaries but same contents.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Just my two cents.
