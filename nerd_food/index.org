* About

Nerd Food is a sporadic "column" I used to have on my blog and has now
been moved here. It contains a number of essays I have made on
programming. Not all essays were copied here, as some were specific to
a given technology that is no longer useful (/e.g./ old versions of
Ubuntu, etc).

These essays one day will be published in book form. When they do, the
next section will be its introduction.

* Introduction

#+begin_quote
The unexamined life is not worth living. -- Socrates
#+end_quote

As we mature, we tend to introspect more and more, to spend time
thinking about the path of one's life. Those little twists and turns
across life's graph, some with dramatic consequences, others less
so. When in this frame of mind, it is good to read what we had once
written, if nothing else because it allows us to judge just how far
one has deviated from those noble ideals of youth.

Having lived most of my life in the technology space, I somewhat
unwittingly ended up narrating my own evolution across it and, to an
extremely limited extent, its evolution too. As such, it seemed only
fair to collect all of these writings --- whatever their merits are in
a literary sense --- in an easy to parse from to facilitate reading.

This book thus contains a selection of essays by yours truly on
software engineering, spanning a period of just over a decade and a
half. It is made up mainly of blog posts taken from my haphazard
column "Nerd Food", as well as a couple of other early essays which
never saw the light of day.
