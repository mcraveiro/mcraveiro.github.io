<h1 class="title">Nerd Food: Interview with Federico Mena-Quintero</h1>
<p>
<a href="../index.html">Back to home page</a>.
</p>

<p>
Wednesday, October 03, 2007
</p>

<p>
Pretty much anyone who is involved with Free Software - even just as
a lowly user like myself - has heard of Federico. His blog is a source
of insightful ideas on Gnome, and lately, on performance - combined
with a healthy dose of interest in politics and, more importantly,
good food. I decided to send a few questions to Federico, mainly on
the topics I was most curious about, and he kindly replied to my
questions - and did so in record time! Many thanks to Federico for
taking time off his busy hacking schedule for this interview.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org99593fb" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org99593fb">Interview</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org99593fb">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>You are one of the founders of the Gnome project, which is
currently celebrating ten years of existence. On a recent interview
you gave to Fosdem, you considered the platform to be
maturing. However, as we all know, the last 10% normally take 90%
of the time, and it's considered to be boring work. What do you
think the Gnome project needs to do to get people to focus on those
remaining 10%?</li>
</ol>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
Basically, to provide an incentive to get that last 10% of the work
done :) Instead of smacking people with a stick for not writing
documentation, you could have a web page with a bar chart of
"percentage of documentation coverage". Then it becomes a competition:
use a carrot instead of a stick.
</p>

<p>
I'd also like companies to get more involved in this. If they want to
ship GNOME as a development platform they support, then they could
very well employ people to do those missing bits.
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>You have been one of the champions of performance in Gnome for a
while now. As functionality increased, Gnome started suffering more
and more from performance problems, particularly when looked at
from a low end perspective. You have been trying to explain to the
masses that performance work is interesting. What do you think can
be done to increase developer focus on this neglected area?</li>
</ol>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
The thing about fixing performance problems is that nobody teaches you
how to do it. There is very little documentation out there on how to
generically approach an optimization problem (I intend to do something
about this, but oh, time, time, time!) :)
</p>

<p>
Also, sometimes you fix a performance problem, but it reappears in the
future. This happens when you don't leave an infrastructure in place
to let you run a benchmark periodically. You need to be able to see if
there are performance regressions.
</p>

<p>
Our tools are slowly getting better, but there are really very few
people working on optimization and profiling tools. It takes a <b>ton</b>
of time and skill to write a good tool; maybe that's why there are so
few of them.
</p>

<p>
Finally, profiling and optimizing is really about following the
scientific method ("make a hypothesis, change one thing at a time,
measure, confirm your hypothesis, etc."). This requires discipline and
a lot of patience.
</p>

<p>
Basically, it's a problem of education :)
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Earlier on this year, Gnome users and developers met for
GUADEC. Did you find the conference as productive as in previous
years? How important is GUADEC for the Gnome user and developer
community?</li>
</ol>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
Yes, this GUADEC was tremendously productive! I think the venue helped
a lot; the Birmingham Conservatoire is rather compact and has nice
practice rooms that anyone can use. So, you could grab a couple of
hackers and go to a room to hack peacefully.
</p>

<p>
GUADEC has always been important, even more so now that our community
is large and widespread. It is about the only time in the year when
most of the GNOME contributors get together in a single place and are
able to talk in person. Do not underestimate the productivity of
talking over a beer :)
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>From the outside world, it appears Novell is a company who has
regained it's soul and direction with Linux. How was the transition
from Ximian into Novell?</li>
</ol>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
Like all acquisitions, it was a bit rought at first. It's what you get
when you switch from being in a small company where you know all of
the employees, to one with several thousands of people. You have to
adjust to bigger processes, more layers of management, new locations,
new paperwork&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
It has been very interesting to see the mindset of the old-time Novell
people change over time. At first they seemed reluctant to touch Linux
and free software, since they were of course Windows users. Then we
had a period with lots of questions, lots of bugs that needed to be
fixed, lots of re-training&#x2026; and now we are in a very nice period,
when people have accepted that we must all use our own free
software. People seem to be productive with it and happy.
</p>

<p>
I miss the monkeys, though.
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>You are currently telecommuting from Mexico, a position envied by a
most developers out there. Do you find that telecommuting helps
improving your productivity? Are there any downsides to it?</li>
</ol>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
It has good things and bad things. Good things: working in your
pajamas if you feel like it, not having to commute, taking a pause
when you are stuck in a hard problem to do a bit of gardening. Bad
things: you can't talk to people in person. You must fix all your
networking problems yourself. Sometimes, when you are uninspired, it's
nice to be able to look over someone else's shoulder or talk to them.
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Can you describe your typical day at work?</li>
</ol>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
Well, since I work from home&#x2026; :)
</p>

<p>
I wake up. If my wife and I are hungry, we make breakfast while my
email gets downloaded. If we are not hungry, I'll just check for
super-urgent email and then start programming (fixing bugs, doing new
development, reviewing patches, etc.).
</p>

<p>
I usually try to get some programming done in the morning, while my
brain is fresh. Processing your email in the morning is a really bad
idea; it will take you up to the afternoon and by then you'll be tired
to really write code.
</p>

<p>
We have lunch at really irregular hours. Sometimes it's more like an
early dinner. I have the bad habit of not stopping working until I'm
exhausted or my wife is angry that we haven't gone out to the
supermarket yet, but I'm trying to fix that :)
</p>

<p>
In the afternoon I tend to do "light" work&#x2026; maintaining wikis,
answering email, coordinating people. I don't really have a fixed work
schedule.
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Many developing countries are increasingly looking at Free Software
as a way to bring down the digital divide. Do you find that Mexico
is taking advantage of Free Software - particularly since it has
two lead Free Software developers? Are there any lessons to be
learned from Mexico's experience?</li>
</ol>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
Mexico is blessed and cursed to be so close to the USA. There is
plenty of basic usage of free software by individuals (often
enthusiastic students), but relatively little usage in the public and
private sectors.
</p>

<p>
People in Mexico get very impressed by rich people; most Mexicans want
to be like the rich people from the USA they see on TV. It's very easy
to woo us into accepting their ways.
</p>

<p>
So, every time there has been some noise about using free software in
the public sector, Bill Gates has flown down, organized a big business
lunch with government officials, and made sure that they keep using
Microsoft products. If you are an ignorant politician, you will love
to gloat that you had lunch (imagine, lunch!) with Bill Gates, the
richest man in the world &#x2014; and whatever he says must be correct, of
course. The problem we have is that most of our politicians don't have
the faintest idea of the economic and cultural implications of free
software, unlike those in the European Union (see the recent report on
the economic impact of free software there!).
