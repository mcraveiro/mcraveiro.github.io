<h2 id="orga608bfa">The Impossibly Scalable System</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga608bfa">
<p>
If development in general is an art or a craft, its finest hour is
perhaps the maintenance of existing systems which have high
availability requirements but are still experiencing high rates of
change. As we covered previously, maintenance in general is a task
much neglected in the majority of commercial shops, and many products
suffer from entropic development; that is, the piling on of changes
which continuously raise the complexity bar, up to a point where it is
no longer cost-effective to continue running the existing system. The
word "legacy" is in itself filled with predestination, implying old
systems cannot avoid time-decay and will eventually rot into oblivion.
</p>

<p>
The story is rather different when one looks at a few successful Free
and Open Source Software (FOSS) systems out there. For starters,
"legacy" is not something one often hears on that side of the fence;
projects are either maintained or not maintained, and can freely flip
from one state to the other. Age is not only <span class="underline">not</span> a bad thing, but,
in many cases, it is a remarkable advantage. Many projects that
survived their first decade are now stronger than ever: the Linux
kernel, x.org, Samba, Postgresql, Apache, gcc, gdb, subversion, GTK,
and many, many others. Some, like Wine, took a decade to mature and
are now showing great promise.
</p>

<p>
Each of these old timers has its fair share of lessons to teach, all
of them incredibly valuable; but the project I'm particularly
interested in is the Linux kernel. I'll abbreviate it to Linux or "the
kernel" from now on.
</p>

<p>
As published recently in a study by Kroah-Hartman, Corbet and
McPherson, the kernel suffers a daily onslaught of unimaginable
proportions. Recent kernels are a joint effort of thousands of kernel
hackers in dozens of countries, a fair portion of which working or
well over 100 companies. On average, these developers added or
modified around 5K lines per day during the 2.6.24 release cycle and,
crucially, removed some 1.5K lines per day - and "day" here includes
weekends too. Kernel development is carried out in hundreds of
different kernel trees, and the merge paths between these trees obeys
no strictly enforced rules - it does follow convention, but rules get
bent when the situation requires it.
</p>

<p>
It is incredibly difficult to convey in words just how much of a
technical and social achievement the kernel is, but one is still
compelled to try. The absolute master of scalability, it ranges from
the tiniest embedded processor with no MMU to the largest of the large
systems - some spanning as many as 4096 processors - and covering
pretty much everything else in between: mobile phones, Set-Top Boxes
(STBs), game consoles, PCs, large severs, supercomputers. It supports
more hardware architectures than any other kernel ever engineered, a
number which seemingly keeps on growing at the same rate new hardware
is being invented. Linux is increasingly the kernel of choice for new
architectures, mainly because it is extremely easy to port. Even real
time - long considered the unassailable domain of special purpose - is
beginning to cave in, unable to resist the relentless march of the
penguin. And the same is happening in many other niches.
</p>

<p>
The most amazing thing about Linux may not even be its current state,
but its pace, as clearly demonstrated by Kroah-Hartman, Corbet and
McPherson's analysis of kernel source size: it has displayed a near
constant growth rate between 2.6.11 and 2.6.24, hovering at around 10%
a year. Figures on this scale can only be supported by a catalytic
development process. And in effect, that is what Linux provides: by
getting better it implicitly lowers the entry barrier to new adopters,
which find it closer and closer to their needs; thus more and more
people join in and fix what they perceive to be the limitations of the
kernel, making it even more accessible to the next batch of adopters.
</p>

<p>
Although some won't admit it now, the truth is none of the
practitioners or academicians believed that such a system could ever
be delivered. After all, Linux commits every single schoolboy error:
started by an "inexperienced" undergrad, it did not have much of an
upfront design, architecture and purpose; it originally had the firm
objective of supporting only a single processor on x86; it follows the
age-old monolithic approach rather than the "established"
micro-kernel; it is written in C instead of a modern, object-oriented
language; its processes appear to be haphazard, including a clear
disregard for Brook's law; it lacks a rigorous Q&amp;A process and until
very recently even a basic kernel debugger; version control was first
introduced over a decade after the project was started; there is no
clear commercial (or even centralised) ownership; there is no "vision"
and no centralised decision making (Linus may be the final arbiter,
but he relies on the opinions of a lot of people). The list continues
ad infinitum.
</p>

<p>
And yet, against all expert advice, against all odds, Linux is the
little kernel that could. If one were to write a spec covering the
capabilities of vanilla 2.6.25, it would run thousands of pages long;
its cost would be monstrous; and no company or government department
would dare to take on such an immense undertaking. Whichever way you
look at it, Linux is a software engineering singularity.
</p>

<p>
But how on earth can Linux work at all, and how did it make it thus
far?

I'm basically a very lazy person who likes to get credit for things
other people actually do. &#x2013; Linus Torvalds

</blockquote></div>

<p>
The engine of Linux's growth is deeply rooted in the kernel's
methodology of software development, but it manifests itself as a set
of core values - a culture. As with any other school of thought, not
all kernel hackers share all values, but the group as a whole displays
some obvious homogeneous characteristics. These we shall call Linus'
Way, and are loosely summarised below (apologies for some redundancy,
but some aspects are very interrelated).

<h3 id="orgb22857f">Small is beautiful</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb22857f">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Design is only useful on the small scale; there is no need to worry
about the big picture - if anything, worrying about the big picture
is considered harmful. Focus on the little decisions and ensure they
are done correctly. From these, a system will emerge that <span class="underline">appears</span>
to have had a grand design and purpose.</li>
<li>At a small scale, do not spend too long designing and do not be
overambitious. Rapid prototyping is the key. Think simple and do not
over design. If you spend too much time thinking about all the
possible permutations and solutions, you will create messy and
unmaintainable code which will very likely going to be wrong. Best
implement a small subset of functionality that works well, is easy
to understand and can be evolved over time to cover any additional
requirements.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgca749e0" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgca749e0">Show me the Code</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgca749e0">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Experimentation is much more important than theory by several orders
of magnitude. You may know everything there is to know about coding
practice and theory, but your opinion will only be heard if you have
solid code in the wild to back it up.</li>
<li>Specifications and class diagrams are frowned upon; you can do them
for your own benefit, but they won't sell any ideas by themselves.</li>
<li>Coding is a messy business and is full of compromises. Accept that
and get on with it. Do not search for perfection before showing code
to a wider audience. Better to have a crap system (sub-system,
module, algorithm, etc.) that works somewhat today than a perfect
one in a year or two. Crap systems can be made slightly less crappy;
vapourware has no redeeming features.</li>
<li>Merit is important, and merit is measured by code. Your ability to
do boring tasks well can also earn a lot of brownie points (testing,
documentation, bug hunting, etc.) and will have a large positive
impact on your status. The more you are known and trusted in the
community, the easier it will be for you to merge new code in and
the more responsibilities you will end up having. Nothing is more
important than merit as gauged by the previous indicators; it
matters not what position you hold on your company, how important
your company is or how many billions of dollars are at stake - nor
does it matter how many academic titles you hold. However, past
actions do not last forever: you must continue to talk sense to have
the support of the community.</li>
<li>Testing is crucial, but not just in the conventional sense. The key
is to release things into a wider population ("Release early,
release often"). The more exposure code has the more likely bugs
will be found and fixed. As ESR put it, "Given enough eyeballs, all
bugs are shallow" (dubbed Linus' law). Conventional testing is also
welcome (the more the merrier), but its no substitute for releasing
into the wild.</li>
<li>Read the source, Luke. The latest code is the only authoritative and
unambiguous source of understanding. This attitude does not in
anyway devalue additional documentation; it just means that the
kernel's source code overrides any such document. Thus there is a
great impetus in making code readable, easy to understand and
conformant to standards. It is also very much in line with Jack
Reeve's view that source code is the only real specification a
software system has.</li>
<li>Make it work first, then make it better. When taking on existing
code, one should always first make it work as intended by the
original coders; then a set of cleanup patches can be written to
make it better. Never start by rewriting existing code.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><span class="underline">anything</span> related to the kernel can change, including processes,
code, tools, fundamental algorithms, interfaces, people. Nothing is
done "just because". Everything can be improved, and no change is
deemed too risky. It may have to be scheduled, and it may take a
long time to be merged in; but if a change is of "good taste" and,
when required, provided the originator displays the traits of a good
maintainer, it will eventually be accepted. Nothing can stand on the
way of progress.</li>
<li>As a kernel hacker, you have no doubts that you are right - but
actively you encourage others to prove you wrong and accept their
findings once they have been a) implemented (a prototype would do,
as long as it is complete enough for the purpose) b) peer reviewed
and validated. In the majority of cases you gracefully accept
defeat. This may imply a turn-around of 180 degrees; Linus has done
this on many occasions.</li>
<li>Processes are made to serve development. When a process is found
wanting - regardless of how ingrained it is or how useful it has
been in the past - it can and will be changed. This is often done
very aggressively. Processes only exist while they provide visible
benefits to developers or, in very few cases, due to external
requirements (ownership attribution comes to mind). Processes are
continuously fine-tuned so that they add the smallest possible
amount of overhead to real work. A process that improves things
dramatically but adds a large overhead is not accepted until the
overhead is shaved off to the bare bone.</li>

One may come up with clever ways of doing things, and even provide
conclusive experimental evidence on how a change would improve
matters; however, if one's change will disrupt existing code and
requires specialised knowledge, then it is important to display the
characteristics of a good maintainer in order to get the changes
merged in. Some of these traits are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Good understanding of kernel's processes;</li>
<li>Good social interaction: an ability to listen to other kernel
hackers, and be ready to change your code;</li>
<li>An ability to do boring tasks well, such as patch reviews and
integration work;</li>
<li>An understanding of how to implement disruptive changes, striving to
contain disruption to the absolute minimum and a deep understanding
of fault isolation.</li>

<h3 id="org23ff601">Patches</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org23ff601">
<p>
Patches have been used for eons. However, the kernel fine-tuned the
notion to the extreme, putting it at the very core of software
development. Thus all changes to be merged in are split into patches
and each patch has a fairly concise objective, against which a review
can be performed. This has forced all kernel hackers to <span class="underline">think</span> in
terms of patches, making changes smaller and concise, and splitting
scaffolding and clean up work and decoupling features from each
other. The end result is a ridiculously large amount of positive
externalities - unanticipated side-effects - such as technologies that
get developed for one purpose but uses that were never dreamt of by
their creator. The benefits of this approach are far too great to
discuss here but hopefully we'll have a dedicated article on the
subject.

<li>Keep politics out. The vast majority of decisions are taken on
technical merits alone, and very rarely for political reasons. Some
times the two coincide (such as the dislike for binary modules in
the kernel), but one must not forget that the key driver is always
the technical reasoning. For instance, the kernel uses the GNU GPL
v2 purely because its the best way to ensure its openness, a key
building block of the development process.</li>
<li>Experience trumps fashion. Whenever choosing an approach or a
technology, kernel hackers tend to go for the beaten track rather
than new and exciting ones. This is not to say there is no
innovation in the kernel; but innovators have the onus of proving
that their approach is better. After all, there is a solid body of
over 30 years of experience in developing UNIX kernels; its best to
stand on the shoulders of giants whenever possible.</li>
<li>An aggressive attitude towards bad code, or code that does not
follow the standards. People attempting to add bad code are told so
in no uncertain terms, in full public view. This discourages many a
developer, but also ensures that the entry bar is raised to avoid
lowering the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If there ever was a single word that could describe a kernel hacker,
that word would have to be "pragmatic". A kernel hacker sees
development as a hard activity that should remain hard. Any other view
of the world would result in lower quality code.

Linus has stated in many occasions he is a big believer of development
by evolution rather than the more traditional methodologies. In a way,
he is the father of the evolutionary approach when applied to software
design and maintenance. I'll just call this the evolutionary
methodology (EM) by want of a better name. EM's properties make it
strikingly different from everything that has preceded it. In
particular, it appears to remove most forms of centralised
control. For instance:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It does not allow you to know where you're heading in the long run;
all it can tell you is that if you're currently on a favourable
state, a small, gradual increment is <span class="underline">likely</span> to take you to
another, slightly more favourable state. When measured in a large
timescale it will appear as if you have designed the system as a
whole with a clear direction; in reality, this "clearness" is an
emergent property (a side-effect) of thousands or small decisions.</li>
<li>It exploits parallelism by trying lots of different gradual
increments in lots of members of its population and selecting the
ones which appear to be the most promising.</li>
<li>It favours promiscuity (or diversity): code coming from anywhere can
intermix with any other code.</li>
</ul>

<p>
But how exactly does EM work? And why does it seem to be better than
the traditional approaches? The search for these answers takes us
right back to the fundamentals. And by "fundamentals", I really mean
the absolute fundamentals - you'll have to grin and bear, I'm
afraid. I'll attempt to borrow some ideas from Popper, Taleb, and
Dawkins to make the argument less nonsensical.
</p>

<p>
That which we call reality can be imagined as a space with a really,
really large number of variables. Just how large one cannot know, as
the number of variables is unknowable - it could even be infinite -
and it is subject to change (new variables can be created; existing
ones can be destroyed, and so on). With regards to the variables
themselves, they change value every so often but this frequency
varies; some change so slowly they could be better describbed as
constants, others so rapidly they cannot be measured. And the
frequency itself can be subject to change.
</p>

<p>
When seen over time, these variables are curves, and reality is the
space where all these curves live. To make matters more interesting,
changes on one variable can cause changes to other variables, which in
turn can also change other variables and so on. The changes can take
many forms and display subtle correlations.
</p>

<p>
As you can see, reality is the stuff of pure, unadulterated complexity
and thus, by definition, any attempt to describe it in its entirety
cannot be accurate. However, this simple view suffices for the
purposes of our exercise.
</p>

<p>
Now imagine, if you will, a model. A model is effectively a) the
grabbing of a small subset of variables detected in reality; b) the
analysis of the behaviour of these variables over time; c) the issuing
of statements regarding their behaviour - statements which have not
been proven to be false during the analysis period; d) the validation
of the models predictions against past events (calibration). Where the
model is found wanting, it needs to be changed to accommodate the new
data. This may mean adding new variables, removing existing ones that
were not found useful, tweaking variables, and so on. Rinse,
repeat. These are very much the basics of the scientific method.
</p>

<p>
Models are rather fragile things, and its easy to demonstrate
empirically why. First and foremost, they will always be incomplete;
exactly how incomplete one cannot know. You never know when you are
going to end outside the model until you are there, so it must be
treated with distrust. Second, the longer it takes you to create a
model - a period during which validation is severely impaired - the
higher the likelihood of it being wrong when its "finished". For very
much the same reasons, the larger the changes you make in one go, the
higher the likelihood of breaking the model. Thirdly, the longer a
model has been producing correct results, the higher the probability
that the next result will be correct. But the exact probability cannot
be known. Finally, a model must endure constant change to remain
useful - it may have to change as frequently as the behaviour of the
variables it models.
</p>

<p>
In such an environment, one has no option but to leave certainty and
absolutes behind. It is just not possible to "prove" anything, because
there is a large component of randomness and unknown-ability that
cannot be removed. Reality is a messy affair. The only certainty one
can hold on to is that of fallibility: a statement is held to be
possibly true until proven false. Nothing else can be said. In
addition, empiricism is highly favoured here; that is, the ability to
look at the data, formulate an hypothesis without too much theoretical
background and put it to the test in the wild.
</p>

<p>
So how does this relate to code? Well, every software system ever
designed is a model. Source code is nothing but a set of statements
regarding variables and the rules and relationships that bind them. It
may model conceptual things or physical things - but they all inhabit
a reality similar to the one described above. Software systems have
become increasingly complex over time - in other words, taking on more
and more variables. An operative system such as multics, deemed
phenomenally complex for its time, would be considered normal by
today's standards - even taking into account the difficult environment
at the time with non-standard hardware, lack of experience on that
problem domain, and so on.
</p>

<p>
In effect, it is this increase in complexity that breaks down older
software development methodologies. For example, the waterfall method
is not "wrong" per se; it can work extremely well in a problem domain
that covers a small number of variables which are not expected to
change very often. You can still use it today to create perfectly
valid systems, just as long as these caveats apply. The same can be
said for the iterative model, with its focus on rapid cycles of
design, implementation and testing. It certainly copes with much
larger (and faster moving) problem domains than the waterfall model,
but it too breaks down as we start cranking up the complexity
dial. There is a point where your development cycles cannot be made
any smaller, testers cannot augment their coverage, etc. EM, however,
is at its best in absurdly complex problem domains - places where no
other methodology could aim to go.
</p>

<p>
In short, EM's greatest advantages in taming complexity are as
follows:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Move from one known good point to another known good point. Patches
are the key here, since they provide us with small units of
reviewable code that can be checked by any experienced developer
with a bit of time. By forcing all changes to be split into
manageable patches, developers are forced to think in terms of
small, incremental changes. This is precisely the sort of behaviour
one would want in a complex environment.</li>
<li>Validate, validate and then validate some more. In other words,
Release Early, Release Often. Whilst Linus has allowed testing and
Q&amp;A infrastructure to be put in place by interested parties, the
main emphasis has always been placed in putting code out there in
the wild as quickly as possible. The incredibly diverse environments
on which the kernel runs provide a very harsh and unforgiving
validation that brings out a great number of bugs that could not
have possibly been found otherwise.</li>
<li>No one knows what the right thing is, so try as many possible
avenues as possible simultaneously. Diversity is the key, not only
in terms of hardware (number of architectures, endless permutations
within the same architecture, etc.), but also in terms of
agendas. Everyone involved in Linux development has their own agenda
and is working towards their own goal. These individual
requirements, many times conflicting, go through the kernel
development process and end up being converted into a number of
fundamental architectural changes (in the design sense, not the
hardware sense) that effectively are the superset of all
requirements, and provide the building blocks needed to implement
them. The process of integrating a large change to the kernel can
take a very long time, and be broken into a sequence of never ending
patches; but many a time it has been found that one patch that adds
infrastructure for a given feature also provides a much better way
of doing things in parts of the kernel that are entirely unrelated.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Not only does EM manage complexity really well but it actually thrives
on it. The pulling of the code base in multiple directions makes it
stronger because it forces it to be really plastic and
maintainable. It should also be quite clear by now that EM can only be
deployed successfully under somewhat limited (but well defined)
circumstances, and it requires a very strong commitment to
openness. It is important to build a community to generate the
diversity that propels development, otherwise its nothing but the
iterative method in disguise done out in the open. And building a
community entails relinquishing the traditional notions of ownership;
people have to feel empowered if one is to maximise their
contributions. Furthermore, it is almost impossible to direct this
engine to attain specific goals - conventional software companies
would struggle to understand this way of thinking.
</p>

<p>
Just to be clear, I would like to stress the point: it is not right to
say that the methodologies that put emphasis on design and centralised
control are wrong, just like a hammer is not a bad tool. Moreover, its
futile to promote one programming paradigm over another, such as
Object-Orientation over Procedural programming; One may be superior to
the other on the small, but on the large - the real world - they
cannot by themselves make any significant difference (class libraries,
however, are an entirely different beast).
</p>

<p>
I'm not sure if there was ever any doubt; but to me, the kernel proves
conclusively that the human factor dwarfs any other in the production
of large scale software.
