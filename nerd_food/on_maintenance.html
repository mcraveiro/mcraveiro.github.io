</p>

<p>
The many years I've spent working for the bespoke industry and using
free software finally made me understand the obvious: the single most
important aspect in the whole of software development is
maintenance. Yes, you heard it right. Its not the language, not the
platform, not the methodologies, not the technologies involved, not
even the pretty Gantt charts. All these tools are important, of
course, but if one looks at the entire lifespan of a program,
maintenance overshadows every other aspect by a wide margin. You may
think I'm not saying anything new here, and with good reason. Classic
texts like Bertrand Meyer's Object Oriented Software Construction
already pointed out that the highest cost in a software project is
maintenance; Meyer was not the first, by far, to pick up on this. The
problem was not with their diagnosis but rather with the cure they
proposed. Allow me to expand on this.
</p>

<p>
The first thing one must realise is that code is in itself the only
complete system specification there is. I'm not going to spend much
time explaining this view of the world since I cannot possibly improve
upon Jack Reeves' "What is Software Design?". Any experienced
developer knows that the only way to really understand how a system
works is by looking at the source. Let's face it, in the real world
manuals don't exist. Comments are sketchy and, more often than not,
totally wrong. You may get developers to write good documentation on
the early stages but in all these years I'm yet to see a large
five-year old project properly documented. The only thing you can
always rely on, the only thing that truly documents the behaviour of a
program is its source code. I know, I know, you'll bring up Knuth and
literate programming. Unfortunately, I have no option but to
check-mate you with real world experience. Sad truth is, most people
don't even know about Knuth. While Doxygen et al are nice and make
documenting much easier, very few people bother making sure the text
matches the source when they are on a tight deadline, and the life of
a bespoke developer is nothing but one tight deadline after another,
ad infinitum. You can imagine your project manager's face when you
explain that the deadline won't be met because you still need to
finishing off commenting.
</p>

<p>
Speaking in very empirical terms, most projects seem to have an
average lifespan of around seven to ten years, with the caveat that
the final stage can drag on for a very long time. The first two or
three years are all about adding large amounts of new features,
cramming in as much as possible in the shortest possible time. During
this period, lurking in the shadows, there is a steady increase of
complexity. If these things were easily quantifiable, I'd expect the
data would display a high correlation between the number of added
features and the increase in complexity (i.e. each feature
dramatically raises the complexity bar). Thus, adding each feature
(and fixing each bug) starts taking longer and longer over time. At
some point the project will reach the "complexity barrier"; this is
the point at which adding new features (or fixing existing bugs) is so
expensive that it's cheaper to create a new product from scratch, one
which addresses all the "scalability" issues that the current system
cannot. At this point the code-base is kept in "life-support" mode,
with a bare minimum number of developers working on it to keep
existing customers happy, but unable to do any fundamental changes to
the project's core. If any new major features are required, they are
implemented by extremely complex workarounds over existing
architectural deficiencies. Eventually, the next generation system
leaves the sheltered green house and is ready for
deployment. Customers are moved over with varying degrees of
grumbling, but with little choice on the matter. This pretty much
describes every other project I have worked on over the last decade,
some of them in different stages, of course, but all of them
describing the exact same arc. First, let's make this clear: this
methodology works. Companies are making ridiculous amounts of money by
religiously following it, and at the end of the day, from a financial
perspective, all that matters is the bottom line. However, this can't
be The Right Way from an engineering perspective. I'm afraid you'll
need your engineering hat on for the remaining of the article.
</p>

<p>
Lets step back for a second and reflect. Why do we throw away
code-bases in the bespoke market so readily, when both commercial and
open source shops do it a lot less frequently? It's all to do with the
development process. Truth is, bespoke projects die <span class="underline">by design</span>; their
environment is so entropic and hostile that they cannot but
die. Software development changed fundamentally when the day to day
running of a project was taken from the hands of programmers and
handed over to professionals. In time, project management became a
science in itself, complete with its own language of Gantt charts,
milestones and deliverables. The entire development ecosystem in which
we now live is geared towards delivering more and more features in
ever smaller timescales by people who have less and less technical
ability - i.e. people that think at ever higher levels of
abstraction. The first victim in this quest for "time to market" is
the code-base. When a developer is asked to implement a new feature
the key question asked by a good project manager is: can you "reuse"
some of the existing infrastructure to do this? The project manager
may not even know what reuse means technically, but he knows that
"with reuse" the estimates are much lower than "without reuse". So
"reuse" is good, writing from scratch or re-engineering is bad, really
bad. The developer will most likely explain that the existing
infrastructure was not designed with the new feature in mind, and so,
given the current timescales, there is no option but to bend the
code-base beyond shape to shoehorn the functionality in (also known as
a kludge). In the ears of a good project manager this is equal to
"yes, we can reuse the existing infrastructure, we'll sort the mess
later". Alas, later never comes. Eventually, after years of kludges to
deliver features, the code-base becomes so unmaintainable - so
complex - that it is cheaper to write a new system from scratch than
to maintain the existing system. The complexity barrier has been
reached, the dreaded point of no return.
</p>

<p>
What the project manager fails to grasp - or does not want to grasp -
is that the code-base is in itself a repository of knowledge of sorts;
the summary of the experience of a large group of developers over a
long period of time attempting to tame a given problem domain. To make
an extreme analogy, this is akin to someone taking every single copy
of every volume of The Art of Computer Programming, writing a few
sketchy notes about in fifty or so pages and then burning the books,
happily thinking that all important detail has been captured. You'd
think that most software houses would understand the importance of the
code-base as an asset; after all, ask to take a copy of the code home
and you'll have the police breathing down your neck in
seconds. However, this sort of behaviour is a bit like the attitude of
the peasant who keeps his money under the mattress, not really knowing
what it's worth but thinking that it must be really
important. Companies don't really understand the value of the
code-base. If they did, they would take <span class="underline">really</span> good care of
it. Instead, they treat it like any other perishable resource, a
computer or a car, a trite commodity spewed out of a production line
of developer drones. The decommissioning of a software system should
always be seen as an immense tragedy, a great loss of
knowledge. Management is just not able to comprehend the amount of
detail that is contained in a code-base, detail that simply cannot be
transposed to a new system and will have to be rediscovered. Problem
is, an existing code-base hasn't got an easily computable dollar
value - man years are a very bad way of estimating effort nor is it
possible to estimate the cost of a yet-to-develop system - so we're
all in the dark. (Not being an expert, I'm not going to try to propose
ways of valuing an existing code-base, but whatever methodology one
comes up with it is bound to produce some astonishingly high figures.)
</p>

<p>
Unconvinced, you may ask, what is so wrong with starting new projects?
After all many lessons can be learned, new technologies can be used
and the end result will be a faster, more featureful, more
maintainable system. Before everyone starts chanting "oh, you luddite
in disguise", it's important to bear in mind the following:
</p>

<p>
The failure rate for new projects is extremely high;
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Incremental changes have a lower risk, whereas big changes are
always highly risky;</li>
<li>Its much easier to estimate costs and timescales in an existing
project which has been running for years rather than on a new one,
for which baselines are yet to be created;</li>
<li>The second system effect forces architects and developers to create
new projects that aim to boil the ocean and use every other new
technology, adding even more variables to an already complex
problem;</li>
<li>New systems introduce a host of new bugs; you're basically trading
an existing set of bugs that are either known, or not known but also
not known to seriously impact production, with an unknown (but
almost always large) quantity;</li>
<li>You'll need to find new people or retrain existing people for the
new skills required - particularly on the developer side, but quite
often in the user side too;</li>
<li>Your system and component requirements will almost always miss vital
features or important little bits of detail and ignore many of the
lessons already learned simply because the latest crop of developers
writing the specs is not aware of them;</li>
<li>Your project planning will almost always underestimate the
complexity of implementing some or all of the existing features;</li>
<li>Your project managers may be excellent at managing an existing
system but totally inexperienced at managing at this huge scale of
uncertainty;</li>
<li>Your developers may be excellent maintainers of an aging code-base
but terrible green house developers, getting continuously lost in
blue-skies approaches;</li>
<li>The architecture of the existing system may not transpose very well
to the new technologies your developers insist in using, limiting
reuse even at this fundamental level.</li>
</ul>

<p>
As you can see, replacing an established system is close to spending a
million dollars in a casino over a few months. If you do win, you'll
make a fortune - but the odds are heavily stacked against you. For all
the reasons above - and probably many more which I failed to uncover -
it is vital to try to keep an existing code-base running healthily,
avoiding the complexity barrier at all costs. In order to do so one
must maintain a system properly. This entails:
</p>

<p>
Removing functionality which is no longer necessary, thereby reducing
complexity; Looking for opportunities to refactor existing code into
separate modules, and replace existing modules with open source
libraries if suitable ones exist; Tracking and fixing <span class="underline">all</span> reported
bugs; Ensuring the code compiles with no warnings at the maximum
warning level; Refactoring code when implementing new functionality
that does not fit the existing infrastructure; Continuously measuring
system performance, ensuring it does not degrade over time; Ensuring
consistency with existing standards and conventions, avoiding in-house
protocols; Improving readability of existing code; Regression testing
the code-base after changes; Striving for platform independence;
Making continuous releases after changes to ensure there isn't a
feature pile-up; in other words, release early, release often.
</p>

<p>
Yep, you've noticed it. These are all obvious tasks, pretty much the
standard you'd expect from an average free software
maintainer. Unfortunately, for reasons outlined above, these tasks are
rarely present in bespoke software houses' project plans. You may find
that some commercial off-the-shelf shops actually take maintenance
seriously, but most bespoke houses just can't afford to spend the
required time on maintenance. IMHO, herein lies the key, the biggest
needed change: project managers have to start allocating slots for
maintenance. They have to treat maintenance work like they treat
enhancements, allocating adequate resources for it, asking developers
to make and keep updated a list of top issues in the code-base and
make sure these are addressed.
</p>

<p>
The intrepid reader may reasonably ask: but what if the system is
designed in such a way that a large new feature just cannot be
implemented within its framework? To that I must counter that <span class="underline">no</span>
feature is too complex as to be unimplementable in <span class="underline">any</span> existing
system which has been well maintained. This is a fallacy in which I
believed for many years but which I think has been comprehensively
disproved by many projects such as the linux kernel, GTK and Qt. Take
the kernel. If a system that was designed to run only on x86, with no
virtual memory, minimal driver support, minimal filesystem support and
all sorts of other constraints can be made to do what linux does today
then any project can do the same. I mean, the v2.6.x kernel has
excellent portability, large SMP scalability, close to real time
scheduling, and many, many more features that are all but impossible
when looking at them from a v0.0.1 perspective. Linus feels quite
strongly about the fact that the kernel was not originally designed to
do any of these things, but <span class="underline">evolved</span> solutions to these problems over
time and in many cases these solutions work extremely well. The
question is not whether it is possible or not, but rather how much
effort is required to get there. And any discussion about resource
allocation must always take into account the huge benefits of keeping
the same code-base.
</p>

<p>
The other important aspect of maintenance is code-base reduction,
mentioned on the first two points above. Code-base reduction may
appear counter-intuitive at first sight; after all, new features must
require adding code. However, the best way to look at this is from a
resource allocation perspective. There is a finite number of
developers, call it d, working on a code-base of a given size, say
<code>s</code>. Let's call <code>c</code> the ratio between <code>s</code> and <code>d</code>. I always dreamed to
come up with a law, and here finally is my chance: Craveiro's law
states that the higher <code>c</code> is, the harder it is to maintain a
code-base. Of course, this is a highly empirical law, but useful
nonetheless. Now, there are two very straightforward ways of reducing
<code>c</code>: either increase the number of developers until you meet Brook's
law, or decrease the size of the code-base until you start impacting
required features. The latter is more interesting, very much
reminiscent of St. Exupry: a designer knows he has achieved perfection
not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left
to take away.
</p>

<p>
Since you can't literally start removing required functionality, the
next best thing is to find other people who are willing to share the
maintenance burden with you, reducing the individual maintenance cost
(if not the overall cost). This is routinely done in open source
projects, and it is incredibly successful. Basically, you want your
developers to aggressively look at parts of your code-base which offer
no discernible competitive advantage; once located, these are stripped
out of the system and added to your company's portfolio of open source
components. These have an important strategic value and should be
managed very carefully (a community needs to be developed around them,
the maintainer must listen to the community, etc.). The end result
should be a significant reduction in your core code-base size.
</p>

<p>
I'll leave you with a couple of interesting corollaries from
Craveiro's law:
</p>

<p>
Like many other "new" technologies, OOP by itself does not help or
hinder the maintenance problem. Regardless of how elegantly your
system is designed and implemented, if you are not maintaining it
properly it will die. Conversely, a system designed in perl that is
actively and adequately maintained may prove to be extremely resilient
to time. <span class="underline">However</span>, choosing a popular language will have an important
indirect impact on maintenance because it will define the size of the
developer pool you can tap.  Java and C# are incredibly useful
programming languages, but not for the reasons you might expect:
i.e. not because of garbage collection, nice syntactical sugar,
improved security or the VM. The one key element that distinguishes
them from most other languages is their extensive and standardised
class library, readily supplemented with huge amounts of open and
close source components. These reduce the footprint of your code-base
dramatically. Why are these languages better than say Delphi or
RogueWave's extensions to C++? Because they insure vendor independence
by standardising most of their interfaces.
