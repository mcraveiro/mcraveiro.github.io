<h2 id="orgbed534e">UNIX Stranger on a Windows Strange Land</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbed534e">
<p>
Like pretty much every other UNIX nerd, I've been stranded on Windows
for long periods many times in my career. Whenever that happens,
cygwin is what keeps me sane and affords me a modicum of productivity
in hostile surroundings.
</p>

<p>
My relationship with Cygwin started in the long forgotten days of B19
when Men were Men and there was no setup.exe - just archives that were
unpacked manually. I even sent a post or two to the mailing list in
those days, or so Google says. One thing I never did was to write
about how Cygwin does its magic, and that's mainly because it has just
worked for the things I needed it to do. Recently I found myself doing
some more advanced stuff and it spurred me to write a post.
</p>

<p>
Before we can understand Cygwin, we need to get some fundamentals out
of the way. However, if you came here just to get a summary of
solutions and implications without necessarily understanding the
fundamentals, feel free to jump straight to Choosing the Environment
that Fits You.

<div id="outline-container-org8d3bc98" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org8d3bc98">The Kernel and User Space</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8d3bc98">
<p>
All operative systems share one feature in common: they all have a
kernel. The job of the average kernel is to do low-level stuff like
allowing multiple processes to share a physical machine without
getting on each others toes. The kernel does this and much, much more,
either through its core code or via dynamically loaded modules such as
the device drivers provided for your graphics card.
</p>

<p>
Kernels vary wildly in how they do things internally; that's why there
are so many different ones. Even more importantly - at least for our
purposes - they greatly differ on how they interface with the layers
above them, somewhat derogatorily known as the "user space". The
kernel exports an interface to the outside world, but this is normally
not meant to be consumed directly; instead users rely on higher-level
components to consume it. There are two sides of this interface: the
API and the ABI. Unfortunately, very frequently we use API to mean a
combination of both, but in reality there is a difference.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0ffc632" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0ffc632">The Kernel Application Programming Interface (API)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0ffc632">
<p>
When we talk about the API we normally mean a set of headers that can
be used to compile code that talks to the kernel directly. For a
simple example for the Linux kernel have a look at the Real Time Clock
Driver Test/Example Program. You can see it includes a linux kernel
header:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #85DDFF; font-weight: bold;">#include</span> <span style="color: #C586C0;">&lt;</span><span style="color: #DB8E73;">stdio.h</span><span style="color: #C586C0;">&gt;</span>
<span style="color: #85DDFF; font-weight: bold;">#include</span> <span style="color: #C586C0;">&lt;</span><span style="color: #DB8E73;">linux/rtc.h</span><span style="color: #C586C0;">&gt;</span>
<span style="color: #85DDFF; font-weight: bold;">#include</span> <span style="color: #C586C0;">&lt;</span><span style="color: #DB8E73;">sys/ioctl.h</span><span style="color: #C586C0;">&gt;</span>
...
</code></pre>

<p>
These are used to talk directly to the RTC, using standard calls such
as ioctl, etc.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org175e1a1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org175e1a1">The Kernel Application Binary Interface (ABI)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org175e1a1">
<p>
From a kernel perspective, its best to think of the ABI as a
specification that allows stitching together binary components. The
ABI is actually huge, and encompasses very many different aspects,
such as:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The system call ABI, exemplified here for linux. It describes how
function calls are setup, how the stack gets cleaned up after the
function call, etc.</li>
<li>The object file format, responsible for describing the layout of
binaries such as executables and shared libraries. Most Unices
support ELF or the older COFF or the even older a.out; Windows uses
PE.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Finally, one last word on internal versus external ABI. Linux tries
very hard to make sure the external ABI is kept stable; this is why
you can run the same binaries on pretty much any version of the kernel
(all things being equal, such as the presence of all dependencies
required by the binary). However, Linux makes no guarantees whatsoever
with regards to the internal ABI. This means you cannot compile device
drivers for a version of the kernel and expect them to work with other
versions; they may, but then again they may not. Windows takes the
opposite approach, trying hard not to break binary compatibility.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc599742" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc599742">UNIX and The C Library</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc599742">
<p>
It is somewhat tautological to say that, on UNIX, the outer edge of
user space begins with the C POSIX Library. It contains all of what is
available on the C Standard Library - that is, the library of
functions and types created for the C programming language - and, in
addition, it also contains POSIX extensions. It may also contain other
non-standard extensions, but we'll ignore these for the sake of
simplification.
</p>

<p>
This entire package is what we commonly call the C Library. If you use
Linux you are probably using glibc, the GNU implementation of the C
Library. Furthermore:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When people refer to the C runtime (CRT) they normally mean the
shared object (or dynamically linked library) providing the binary
implementation of the C Standard Library;</li>
<li>to <i>link statically</i> against the C runtime means that your
application will contain the entire run-time rather than share one
with other applications.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now, its important to bear in mind that there's nothing particularly
magical about the C library; is just a set of functions defined by the
C programming language and the POSIX standardisation
process. Externally it looks like pretty much any other library. What
tends to make the C Library a bit special is that pretty much
everything on a UNIX system depends on it in one form or
another. Also, unlike other libraries, the C Library makes use of
kernel APIs to implement the interfaces it exports, and as such it
shields the layers above from the vagaries of any particular kernel.
</p>

<p>
You are probably wondering if these functions would not also be useful
to the kernel itself. After all, it is more often than not built in C,
right? Unfortunately, due to the highly circular nature of the
problem, the kernel cannot make use of the C Library. The kernel uses
what is commonly referred to as pure C; that is, only the core C
language itself. It must provide its own implementation of all
required functions, which can be inspired by code in the C library.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org183453a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org183453a">The Windows API</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org183453a">
<p>
On Windows - as always - things are not quite as simple. The Windows
API is the equivalent outer edge of user space on Windows-land (when I
say API here, I really mean API + ABI, which is traditionally what
people mean). Instead of a nice separation of core APIs that interface
with the kernel, the Windows API appears to users as one big monolith
with many, many responsibilities all bundled together. In reality, its
actually made up of a great number of distinct libraries, but that's
not how it seems to the untrained eye.
</p>

<p>
As far as the C Library is concerned, well, it has no direct equivalent. The C Standard Library exists on Windows, of course, but its not seen as a core component of the operative system; its more of a add-on which you can install if required. If one could access the source, one imagines that its implementation makes use of Windows API calls rather than calling the kernel directly - but this is gross speculation from my part. Implementation details aside, its fair to say that the C Standard Library works just fine on Windows.
</p>

<p>
The crux of all our problems is the POSIX API. When a UNIX developer
means "POSIX" he or she means the whole shebang: threads, processes,
sockets, etc. - pretty much a complete wrapper around the
functionality provided by the kernel. Unfortunately, POSIX is very
much a suite of standards, and its not hard to cherry pick the easier
bits and claim compliance for marketing purposes; this was what
Microsoft did in the NT 3.51 days.
</p>

<p>
To be fair to Microsoft, these days they provide a decent
implementation on their high-end systems (Interix, or Subsystem for
Unix-based Applications, can't quite keep up with the names). However,
its not everywhere by default and its a bit too late to fix the damage
done by its absence.
</p>

<p>
The other thing to notice is the potential impedance mismatch between
the NT kernel API and POSIX. The NT kernel comes from a VMS heritage
and as such is further apart from POSIX, which was in many ways the
standardisation of what was then current UNIX practice. The further
apart these two are, the higher the cost of the translation.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org039af1d" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org039af1d">The many facets of Cygwin</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org039af1d">
<p>
It should be fairly clear by now what the first role of Cygwin is: it
aims to provide the missing POSIX API and run time that is required by
the majority of applications designed for Linux and other Unices. This
it provides via its many DLLs such as cygwin.dll. So all software that
runs on Cygwin requires these DLLs - very much like the C Library on
Linux is a central dependency.
</p>

<p>
The second aspect of Cygwin is a bit less obvious. In my quest to
explain hows things work I simplified things a bit: POSIX is not only
a set of APIs - its also an environment. Yep you heard that right, it
is well within the rights of POSIX applications to expect the presence
of the Bourne shell (sh) and a host of other utilities such as make
and ls.
</p>

<p>
You may argue that a large number of applications can happily function
without bash or ls. Indeed they can - at run-time; however, bear in
mind that someone has to build these applications somewhere and it is
this very compilation process that tends to require a POSIX
environment. Visual Studio does contain fairly capable C and C++
compilers, and one can even access them for free these days using the
Express Edition; however, this is a recent development and as such
most Linux applications do not have Visual Studio solutions or msbuild
files, so its not possible to build them directly from Visual Studio.
</p>

<p>
The second aspect of Cygwin is then to provide this environment under
which to build applications - loosely called a toolchain. As the DLL
got closer and closer to POSIX, more and more software has been ported
over, making the toolchain closer and closer to Linux; this in turn
has made the porting of additional software easier, and the process
fed on itself. These days the traditional configure, make and make
install are likely to work for a very large number of applications
available on a Linux distribution; most of these are the applications
shipped with Cygwin, the distribution - its third aspect.
</p>

<p>
As with everything in life, there's always a cost. You may have heard
complaints about Cygwin's performance. Personally I can't moan too
much but I guess that if you are running performance sensitive code
such as say PostgreSQL under high loads you are likely to notice
it. This is for two reasons:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>there is a natural impedance mismatch between the Windows API and
POSIX, as described on the previous section; ironing out this
mismatch has to cost CPU cycles;</li>
<li>as a regular Windows denizen, Cygwin has to go via the public
Windows API instead of talking directly to the kernel, and as such
misses some potential optimisations that Interix/SUA may be using.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org98fb277" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org98fb277">MinGW and MSYS</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org98fb277">
<p>
Some people are not happy with the dependency on Cygwin, either due to
the performance reasons outlined above or due to its fairly viral GPL
licence. MinGW tries to plug this gap in the market, providing the
following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a native port of the GNU toolchain to Windows, including GCC, make,
etc. These are full-blown windows applications with no other
dependencies;</li>
<li>the MinGW run-time: headers and lib files that allow compiling
against the Microsoft C Standard Library;</li>
<li>a set of Windows API headers required to compile code against the
Windows API.</li>
</ul>

<p>
With these three things one can build native Windows applications that
do not rely on POSIX at all (they can, of course, rely on any POSIX
functionality Windows may offer directly).
</p>

<p>
As explained previously, many applications require a POSIX environment
on which to build; for instance they may make use of shell scripts so
bash is a requirement. To aid in this department, MinGW comes with
MSYS, which is effectively an extremely cut-down fork of Cygwin that
contains a very minimalist environment with bash, ls and so on. While
it may work out of the box for simple use cases, you may find its a
bit too basic for non-trivial applications. For instance we found that
the version of tar supplied didn't support 32-bit GIDs, causing a lot
of spurious warnings. If a basic package like tar, which is trivially
used for installing software, must be tinkered with in order to work
you can imagine the difficulties in compiling large and complex
applications. This is probably not a problem for the typical low-level
MinGW user, probably accustomed to embedded development, but it makes
it slightly less accessible to the casual developer not interested in
the guts of the implementation.
</p>

<p>
As you probably already guessed, nothing stops you from using MinGW
from within Cygwin; in fact, it's available as a package. Doing this
gives you the advantages of a full-blown POSIX environment in which to
build, rather than the spartan MSYS, whilst still allowing you to
generate binaries that do not require Cygwin to run. If you do not
want to spend time setting up basic environmental details then Cygwin
is the right choice for a key-in-hand solution for a UNIX environment
on Windows.
</p>

<p>
More interesting still, you can run MinGW directly on Linux. Once GCC
was taught how to generate binaries for the Windows platform, the next
logical step was to allow it to cross-compile these binaries in
Linux. This basically means that a MinGW version of GCC is available
on your Linux distribution as an ELF binary which is able to generate
PE binaries that can be executed on Windows. In this case you won't
need MSYS as Linux already provides you with a POSIX environment in
which to build. To put things slightly more technically, you can use
Linux as both the build and host system, and generate binaries that
target Windows.

Finally, a word about MinGW-w64. Originally MinGW only targeted
Windows 32-bit - hence why you may see MinGW32 in a lot of places; as
64-bit became more popular, a compiler for it was required - that's
where MinGW-w64 came in. These days it provides both 32-bit and 64-bit
compilers and it distinguishes itself by both covering more of the
Windows API and providing really recent GCC releases. For instance,
snapshots of GCC 4.8 are already available from their download site.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0c8e221">
<p>
A word on Wine is required for symmetry purposes. In many ways, Wine
is the mirror image of Cygwin, in that it provides the Windows API to
Linux; but its important to note that whereas Cygwin requires you to
compile your sources and generate PE binaries to run on Windows, Wine
actually goes one step further and allows running the PE binaries
directly on Linux without any modification.
</p>

<p>
This is much, much more difficult. I can't stress enough that Wine is
not providing an emulator or VM to run PE binaries - just like Cygwin
is not providing an emulator to run ELF binaries. Instead, and unlike
Cygwin, Wine provides a program loader that understands the PE format
and is responsible for loading them into memory (you can read about
all the gory details here.). Wine also has to provide all the headers
for the Windows API so that you can compile full-blown Windows
applications on Linux. And, of course, it provides a clean room
implementation of the Windows API itself in order for you to be able
to run the binaries.
</p>

<p>
One can imagine that it could be possible to recompile the entire
Windows API under linux using ELF and then compile and run perfectly
happy applications. Not withstanding any technical challenges - half
of windows is probably hard-coded to use PE - this would not be a
particularly useful thing to do because it would then require
recompiling every other windows application under Linux and since we
don't have the source for them this is a non-starter. For Cygwin it
makes perfect sense, but not for Wine.
</p>

<p>
MinGW shines on Wine too because you can now build and run Windows
applications on Linux without requiring windows at all. Wine provides
its won version of MinGW called winegcc.

If you need to develop on Windows or for Windows, the following
checklist may be of assistance:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Are you building and targeting only Windows?</b> Use Visual Studio
with Cygwin to provide you with a nice UNIX like environment with
bash, grep and the like. This gives you the best compiler for your
platform. You will have to deal with the many quirks of Visual
Studio, but on the plus side you can run a lot of it from the
command line. Using CMake to generate solutions will make things
even easier.</li>
<li><b>Are you developing from Linux but targeting Windows?</b> Use a MinGW
cross-compiler to produce the binaries and Wine to test the binaries
locally.</li>
<li><b>Do you need to target both Linux as well as Windows and your code
is very POSIX dependent?</b> You will probably need either Cygwin or
Interix. If your software is closed source, you will have to pay
RedHat a licence to use Cygwin.</li>
<li><b>Do you need to target both Linux as well as Windows and your code
is not too POSIX dependent?</b> Use MinGW to build on Windows and
regular GCC to build on Linux. If you want a lightweight POSIX
environment to minimise the risk of unwanted and unnecessary
dependencies, use MSYS. It will provide you with a bare-bones
environment but it will also allow you to compile against something
very close to the windows API. If you need a richer POSIX
environment use MinGW from Cygwin.</li>
<li><b>Do you want to use GCC on Windows without UNIX?</b> Install MinGW and
use GCC from a cmd.exe shell. If you need a UI, use CodeBlocks.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We're avoiding the more exotic scenarios such as building Linux
binaries on Windows or running Cygwin on Wine.
