<div id="outline-container-org35a6228" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org35a6228">The Gnome Has Been Losing Weight</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org35a6228">
<p>
If you're a Linux head, in particular a Gnome one, you've bound to
have noticed the huge amount of work on optimization that has been
carried out of late. People such as Federico, Ben Maurer, Michael
Meeks, the OLPC guys and many, many others have been tireless in their
efforts of shaving memory and cycles from all sorts of libraries and
applications in the Gnome stack. There is even talk of colouring
functions according to their cost so that developers are more aware of
the price they'll pay when they make function calls.
</p>

<p>
I believe no one, outside or inside the Gnome camp, will dispute that
it has gotten a bit too fat. Even Gnome 2.16 (desktop and
applications) seems to require 512 Mb of RAM to run comfortably. Yes,
one can squeeze it to fit 256 Mb - or even 128 Mb - but such
configurations are only usable with one or two applications running
simultaneously, and certainly no more than one user on the
machine. Some people may argue that this fattening is an inevitable
consequence of the Free Software development methodology: since most
developers are scratching their itch, and their itch is features,
there is no natural evolutionary pressure towards efficiency.
</p>

<p>
There is, perhaps, some merit in this line of thinking. However, I
think it takes a static view of software development, an activity
which is inherently dynamic. In my view, there's nothing wrong with
focusing on features. First create an app, load it with functionality
and expose it to the world (as always "release early, release
often"). Then, once the problem domain is understood, factor out
common code into libraries that can be used by other applications
requiring the same functionality. Finally, when the libraries are
proved to be a bottleneck, optimise them. This generalisation models
the life-cycle of many free applications. Take the GIMP, for
example. First, it made sense to have GTK in the GIMP. One had to
explore the problem domain and get something out there first. Then,
the library became sufficiently useful that it made sense to separate
the two. Now there is a large community of applications that depend on
GTK, and the bottlenecks are being investigated by a rather large
number of developers. Remember Hoare? "Premature optimization is the
root of all evil". This is optimization done at the optimal time.
</p>

<p>
In addition, this demonstrates one of the strongest points of Free
Software: its emphasis in reuse. This is such an interesting topic
that deserves an entire post on its own, so we'll save that discussion
proper for later. With regards to optimization, the best thing about
reuse is that, when someone spots and fixes a particular memory or CPU
hog, all applications that depend on the offending library will
benefit from the fix. In many cases, these changes don't even require
modifications at the application level - just an upgrade to the latest
version of the shared library. While in theory the exact same logic
applies to commercial software, the reality is that vendor lock-in and
NIH stop reuse at the scale done in the Free Software community. In
addition, few vendors have the incentive to continuously optimise
their wares.
</p>

<p>
So, in my view, bloat in free software applications or libraries is
not a bad thing per se; it just denotes that the application or
library just hasn't reached maturity yet. Which brings me neatly to my
next point.
</p>

<p>
Gnome, as it stands is pretty much feature complete for the vast
majority of users. There are things missing, but these are mainly
polish. Once the multimedia situation is comprehensively sorted out -
and GStreamer seems to be on the way to achieve this objective, in
particular by allowing both free and commercial codecs to coexist -
we're pretty much there. Now, I know you'll disagree and tell me that
feature X is stopping you from migrating to Gnome. I personally
believe that Wine is the key to really unlock the Windows market; but
this is not what we are talking about here. Gnome is now good enough
for most normal users: people that browse the web, write documents,
and need access to email; kids that want to learn to program; people
that need to learn basic computer literacy skills; small
businesses. As far as providing an alternative goes, well, we're
there.
</p>

<p>
It will be an incredibly difficult battle to unseat Microsoft (even an
impossible one), but, as any good General knows, one should fight the
battles one can win - not the battles we're sure to lose. Going
straight after Microsoft's 90% share of the desktop market is
suicidal. One has to look for the easy pickings first. This is what
Free Software has done very successfully in many segments; and it is
the Right Thing for the desktop too.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3fcffc8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3fcffc8">The Battle at the Low End of the Market</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3fcffc8">
<p>
Everyone knows that there is one important dent in Microsoft's armour:
its constant upgrade cycle requires more and more hardware and more
and more money for licences. The hardware costs were originally
exploited by Linux in the fight for the server market but the low
prices have made it less significant as a competitive advantage in
that segment.
</p>

<p>
However, on the desktop front this hasn't been exploited at all. In
the past, one could say that Gnome and its applications used a lot
less resources than Windows. I remember Gnome pre-1.0 happily running
on 64 Mb of RAM on my 486-DX. The problem then was lack of
features. The features are there now but this was a bit of a phyrric
victory for the low end as the footprint has increased
dramatically. One can hardly say that Gnome uses significantly less
resources than Windows XP. The converse may even be true, although
this is disputable. No matter; the key point here is you can't run the
latest version of Gnome with a web browser, an email client, a
spreadsheet and a word processor open on a Pentium I with 64 megs of
RAM. The thing is, you can do all of these things with Windows
95/98. Which is why, when you go to the developing world you see lots
of people running these versions of Windows on the hardware they can
afford.
</p>

<p>
Microsoft has no interest in this end of the market. Little money can
be made by making windows lighter. Getting Vista to run on a Pentium I
does not provide Microsoft with any additional revenue: if you can't
afford the latest hardware, you can't afford Vista anyway. But think
about it: if you could run a full blown Gnome the same way you can run
Windows 95/98 on a Pentium I with 64 megs of RAM, suddenly you can get
access to the latest applications and features. There is no
competition between Windows 95/98 and Gnome 2.16 or later; its a
battle we're sure to win. Even if Microsoft were to give away free
licences of these operating systems, just on functionality alone Gnome
would win. And, as we've seen, there is no incentive to get Vista or
XP to run on low end.
</p>

<p>
Being in Africa made me realise just how much we take things for
granted. In Europe everyone has broadband, TFT monitors and fast
machines at home. When you travel around in Africa you see top end
cybercafes with Pentium IIIs and connections that make Dial Up look
fast. Very few people have PCs at home. The thing is, they could
actually afford them. A Pentium I in England is so cheap as to be
practically free. And yet, you see high-school students paying
extortionate fees to use cybercafes (of course, electricity at home is
also an issue but we can't do much on that front).
</p>

<p>
When I was in Namibia I spoke to a well-off high-school student who
was learning Turbo Pascal at school. I also learned Turbo Pascal at
school, but that was in 1992 and it was already passe in England -
Portugal has always been a bit behind the times. But these guys are
learning it in 2006. This makes me cringe. And all because these are
the licences they can afford on the hardware they can afford. They
could and should using Monodevelop to learn C#, Eclipse to lean Java
or Anjuta to learn C/C++. But none of these fit the hardware they've
got. Africa is performing so badly in the information age one can't
even say its competing at all.
</p>

<p>
One can easily imagine that the same thing happens all over India and
China, but because these countries are so big everyone focuses on the
privileged 10% of the population. Although hardware is getting cheaper
and cheaper, low end second-hand hardware will always be cheaper if
not free; and there's always someone who can only afford the cheapest.
</p>

<p>
And before you mention LTSP, remember how hard it is get it setup. You
may think its easy, and sure, its has progressed quite a lot, but it
still not as easy as installing Windows 95/98. And it requires at
least one decent PC as the main server, plus a network.
</p>

<h2 id="orgc49b6e9">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc49b6e9">
<p>
OLPC and associated initiatives are an eye opener for what can be done
to bridge the digital divide. However, the front in the fight for the
low end should be extended not just to special slimmed versions of
important programs or to smaller, less featureful environments such as
XFCE; there is much to be gained in having the latest and greatest
versions of Gnome targeting low end hardware.
</p>

<p>
Just imagine if Ubuntu, with its easy installation and setup, was
available on low end hardware. And I don't mean Xubuntu, I mean the
normal, standard Ubuntu.
</p>

<p>
Whilst the Gnome hackers are doing a sterling job in general,
optimising as much as they can, there is scope for more action. In my
view, companies such as IBM, Novell, Redhat, Canonical and perhaps
Google should get together and fund a comprehensive dieting program
for Gnome and Linux in general. Whilst this is not something that can
benefit any one particular actor in the Free Software community - as
we've seen, there isn't much money to be made right now at the low
end - it would have huge implications for the future. Linux could
become the defacto operative system for the low end market, replacing
Windows 95/98 and thus opening the doors for future growth.
