Many developers in large companies tend to be exposed to a strange
variation of agile which I like to call "Enterprise Grade Agile", but
I've also heard it called "Fragile" and, most aptly, "Cargo-Cult
Agile". However you decide to name the phenomena, the gist of it is
that these setups contain nearly all of the ceremony of agile -
including stand-ups, sprint planning, retrospectives and so on - but
none of its spirit. Tweets such as this are great at capturing the
essence of the problem:
</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Top
tip: if you need to bring a notepad to the daily stand up to tell us
what you did yesterday that&#39;s too many details</p>&mdash; Fran
Buontempo (@fbuontempo) <a
href="https://twitter.com/fbuontempo/status/686856528696086528">January
12, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async
src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>
Once you start having that nagging feeling of doing things "because
you are told to", and once your stand-ups become more of a status
report to the "project manager" and/or "delivery manager" - the
existence of which, in itself, is rather worrying - your Cargo Cult
Agile alarm bells should start ringing. As I see it, agile is a
toolbox with a number of tools, and they only start to add value once
you've adapted them to your personal circumstances. The fitness
function that determines if a tool should be used is how much value it
adds to all (or at least most) of its users. If it does not, the tool
must be further adapted or removed altogether. And, crucially, you
learn about agile tools by using them and by reflecting on the lessons
learned. There is no other way.
</p>

<p>
This post is one such exercise and the tool I'd like to reflect on is
the <i>Product Backlog</i>. Now, before you read through the whole rant,
its probably worth saying that this post takes a slightly narrow and
somewhat "advanced" view of agile, with a target audience of those
already using it. If you require a more introductory approach, you are
probably better off looking at other online resources such as <a href="http://zerodollarbill.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/how-to-learn-scrum-in-10-minutes-and.html">How to
learn Scrum in 10 minutes and clean your house in the process</a>. Having
said that, I'll try to define terms best I can to make sure we are all
on the same page.

<div id="outline-container-org3483c7a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3483c7a">Working Definition</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3483c7a">
<p>
Once your company has grokked the basics of agile and starts to move
away from those lengthy specification documents - those that no one
reads properly until implementation and those that never specified
anything the customer wanted, but everything we thought the customer
wanted and then some - you will start to use the product backlog in
anger. And that's when you will realise that it is not quite as simple
as memorising text books.
</p>

<p>
So what do the "text books" say? Let's take a fairly typical
definition - this one from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">Scrum</a>:
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
The agile product backlog in Scrum is a prioritized features list,
containing short descriptions of all functionality desired in the
product. When applying Scrum, it's not necessary to start a project
with a lengthy, upfront effort to document all
requirements. Typically, a Scrum team and its product owner begin by
writing down everything they can think of for agile backlog
prioritization. This agile product backlog is almost always more than
enough for a first sprint. The Scrum product backlog is then allowed
to grow and change as more is learned about the product and its
customers.<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Source: <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/product-backlog">Scrum Product Backlog</a>, Mountain Goat Software.
</span>
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
This is a good working definition, which will suffice for the purposes
of this post. It is deceptively simple. However, as always, one must
remember Yogi Berra: "In theory, there is no difference between theory
and practice. But in practice, there is."
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org646d32d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org646d32d">Potmenkin Product Backlogs</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org646d32d">
<p>
Many teams finish reading one such definition, find it amazingly
inspiring, install the "agile plug-in" on their bug-tracking software
of choice and then furiously start typing in those tickets. But if you
look closely, you'd be hard-pressed to find any difference between the
bug tickets of old versus the "stories" in the new and improved
"product backlog" that apparently you are now using.
</p>

<p>
This is a classic management disconnect, whereby a renaming exercise
is applied and suddenly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potemkin_village">Potemkin village-style</a>, we are now in with
the kool kids and our company suddenly becomes a modern and desirable
place to work. But much like Potemkin villages were not designed for
real people to live in, so "Potmenkin Product Backlogs" are not
designed to help you manage the lifecycle of a real product; they are
there to give you the <i>appearance</i> of doing said management, for the
purposes of reporting to the higher eschelons and so that you can tell
stakeholders that "their story has been added to the product backlog
for prioritisation".
</p>

<p>
Alas, very soon you will find that the bulk of the "user stories" are
nothing but glorified one-liners that no one seems to recall what
exactly they're supposed to mean, and those few elaborately detailed
tickets end up rotting because they keep being deprioritised and now
describe a world long gone. Soon enough you will find that your sprint
planning meetings will cover less and less of the product backlog -
after all, who is able to prioritise this mess?  Some stories don't
even make any sense! The final act is when all stories worked on are
stories raised directly on the sprint backlog, and the product backlog
is nothing but the dumping ground for the stories that didn't make it
on a given sprint. At this stage, the product backlog is in such a
terrible mess that no one looks at it, other than for the occasional
historic search for valuable details on how a bug was
fixed. Eventually the product backlog is zeroed - maybe a dozen or so
of the most recent stories make it through the cull - and the entire
process begins anew. Alas, enlightenment is never achieved, so you are
condemned to repeat this cycle for all eternity.
</p>

<p>
As expected, the Potmenkin Product Backlog adds very little value - in
fact it can be argued that it detracts value - but it must be kept
because "agile requires a product backlog".

<h2 id="org2cd9b7c">Bug-Trackers: Lessons From History</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2cd9b7c">
<p>
In order to understand the difficulties with a product backlog, we
turn next to their logical predecessors: bug-tracking systems such as
<a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a> or <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a>. This post starts with a quote from the kernel's
Benevolent Dictator that illustrates the problem with these. Linus has
long taken the approach that there is no need for a bug-tracker in
kernel development, although he does not object if someone wants to
use one for a subsystem. You may think this is a very primitive
approach but in some ways it is also a <i>very</i> modern approach, very
much in line with agile; if you have a bug-tracking system which is
taking time away from developers without providing any value, you
should <i>remove</i> the bug-tracking system. In kernel development, there
simply is no space for ceremony - or, for that matter, for anything
which slows things down<label for="2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
A topic which I covered some time ago here: <a href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2008/06/nerd-food-on-evolutionary-methodology.html">On
Evolutionary Methodology</a>. It is also interesting to see how the kernel
processes are organised for speed: <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/670209/">How 4.4's patches got to the
mainline</a>.
</span>.
</p>

<p>
All of which begs the question: what makes bug-tracking systems so
useless? From experience, there are a few factors:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>they are a "fire and forget" capture system. Most users only care
about entering new data, rather than worrying about the lifecycle of
a ticket. Very few places have some kind of "ticket quality control"
which ensures that the content of the ticket is vaguely sensible,
and those who do suffer from another problem:</li>
<li>they require dedicated teams. By this I don't just mean running the
bug-tracking software - which you will most likely have to do in a
proprietary shop; I also mean the entire notion of Q&amp;A and Testing
as separate from development, with reams of people dedicated to
setting "environments" up (and keeping them up!), organising
database restores and other such activities that are incompatible
with current best practices of software development.</li>
<li>they are temples of ceremony: a glance at the myriad of fields you
need to fill in - and the rules and permutations required to get
them exactly right - should be sufficient to put off even the most
ardent believer in process. Most developers end up memorising some
safe incantation that allows them to get on with life, without
understanding the majority of the data they are entering.</li>
<li>as the underlying product ages, you will be faced with <a href="http://tinyletter.com/programming-beyond-practices/letters/the-sad-graph-of-software-death">the sad graph
of software death</a>. The main problem is that resources get taken away
from systems as they get older, a phenomena that manifests itself as
a growth in the delta between the number of open tickets against the
number of closed tickets. This is actually a <i>really</i> useful metric
but one that is often ignored.<label for="3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Another topic which I also covered here some time
ago: <a href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2007/05/nerd-food-on-maintenance.html">On Maintenance</a>.
</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
And what of the newest iterations on this venerable concept such as
<a href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues/">GitHub Issues</a>? Well, clearly they solve a number of the problems
above - such as lowering the complexity and cost barriers - and
certainly they do serve a very useful purpose: they allow the
efficient management of user interactions. Every time I create an
issue - such as this <a href="https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck/issues/852">one</a> - it never ceases to amaze me how easily the
information flows within GitHub projects; one can initiate comms with
the author(s) or other users with <i>zero setup</i> - something that
previously required mailinglist membership, opening an account on a
bug-tracker and so forth. We now take all of this for granted, of
course, but it is important to bear in mind that many open source
projects would probably not even have <i>any</i> form of user interaction
support, were it not for GitHub. After all, most of them are a
one-person shop with very little disposable time, and it makes no
sense to spend part of that time maintaining infrastructure for the
odd person or two who may drop by to chat.
</p>

<p>
However, for all of its glory, it is also important to bear in mind
that GitHub Issues is <b>not</b> a product backlog solution. What I mean by
this is that the product backlog must be owned by the team that owns
the product and, as we shall see, it must be carefully groomed if it
is to be continually useful. This is at loggerheads with allowing free
flow of information from users. Your Issues will eventually be filled
up with user requests and questions which you may not want to address,
or general discussions which may or may not have a story behind
it. They are simply different tools for different jobs, albeit with an
overlap in functionality.
</p>

<p>
So, history tells us what does not work. But is the product backlog
even worth all this hassle?

<div id="outline-container-orgb75c5c6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb75c5c6">Voyaging Through Strange Seas of Thought</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb75c5c6">
<p>
One of the great things about agile is how much it reflects on itself;
a strange loop of sorts. Presentations such as Kevlin Henney's <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/architecture-uncertainty">The
Architecture of Uncertainty</a> are part of this continual process of
discovery and understanding, and provide great insights about the
fundamental nature of the development process. The product backlog
plays - or should play - a crucial role exactly because of this
uncertain nature of software development. We can explain this by way
of a device.
</p>

<p>
Imagine that you start off by admitting that you know very little
about what it is that you are intending to do and that the problem
domain you are about to explore is vast and complex. In this scenario,
the product backlog is the sum total of the knowledge gained whilst
exploring this space that has yet not been transformed into source
code. Think of it like the explorer's maps in the fifteen-hundreds. In
those days, "users" knew that much of it was incorrect and a great
part was sketchy and ill-defined, but it was all you had. Given that
the odds of success were stacked against you, you'd hold that map
pretty tightly while the storms were raging about you. Those that made
it back would provide corrections and amendments and, over time, the
maps eventually converged with the real geography.
</p>

<p>
The product backlog does something similar, but of course, the space
you are exploring does not have a fixed geometry or topography and
your knowledge of the problem domain can actively <i>change</i> the domain
itself too - an unavoidable consequence of dealing with pure thought
stuff. But the general principle applies. Thus, in the same way <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html">a code
base is precious</a> because it embodies the sum total knowledge of a
domain - heck, in many ways it <i>is</i> the sum total knowledge of a
domain! - so the product backlog is precious because it captures all
the known knowledge of these yet-to-be-explored areas. In this light,
you can understand statements such as this:
</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">

Up to this point - whilst we were delving into the problem space - we
have been dealing with a fairly general argument, likely applicable to
many. Now, as we enter the solution space, I'm afraid I will have to
move from the general to the particular and talk only about the
specific circumstances of my one-man-project <a href="https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen">Dogen</a>. You can find
Dogen's product backlog <a href="https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/product_backlog.org">here</a>.

This may sound like a bit of a cop out, you may say, and not without
reason: how on earth are you supposed to extrapolate conclusions from
a one-person open source project to a team of N working on a
commercial product? However, it is also important to take into account
what I said at the start: agile is what you make of it. I personally
think of it as a) the smallest amount of processes required to make
your development process work smoothly and b) and the continual
improvement of those processes. Thus, there are no one-size-fits-all
solutions; all one can do is to look at others for ideas. So, lets
look at my findings<label for="4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
I am self-plagiarising a little bit here and
rehashing some of the arguments I've used before in <a href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/nerd-food-dogen-lessons-in-incremental.html">Lessons in
Incremental Coding</a>, mainly from section DVCS to the Core.

<p>
The first and most important thing I did to help me manage my product
backlog was to use a simple text file in <a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a> notation. Clearly,
this is not a setup that is workable for a development team much
larger than a set of one, or one that doesn't use Emacs (or <a href="https://github.com/hsitz/VimOrganizer">Vim</a>). But
for my particular circumstances it has worked <i>wonders</i>:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the product backlog is close to the code, so wherever you go, you
take it with you. This means you can always search the product
backlog and - most importantly - add to it <i>wherever</i> you are and
<i>whenever</i> an idea happens to come by. I use this flexibility
frequently.</li>
<li>the Org Mode interface makes it really easy to move stories up and
down (order is taken to mean priority here) and to create "buckets"
of stories according to whatever categorisation you decide to use,
up to any level of nesting. At some point you end up converging to a
reasonable level of nesting, of course. It is surprising how one can
manage <b>very</b> large amounts of stories thanks to this flexible tree
structure.</li>
<li>it's trivial to move stories in and out of a sprint, keeping track
of all changes to a story - they are just text that can be copy and
pasted and committed.</li>
<li>Org Mode provides a very capable <a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/Tags.html">tagging system</a>. I first started by
overusing these, but when tagging got too fine grained it became
unmaintainable. Now we use too few - just <code>epic</code> and <code>story</code> - so
this will have to change again in the near future. For example, it
should be trivial to add tags for different components in the system
or to mark stories as bugs or features, etc. <a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/Tag-searches.html#Tag-searches">Searching</a> then allows
you to see a subset of the stories that match those labels.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A second decision which has proven to be a very good one has been to
groom the product backlog <i>very often</i>. And by this I don't just mean
a cursory look, but a deep inspection of <i>all</i> stories, fixing them
where required. Again, the choice of format has proved very helpful:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>it is easy to mark all stories as "non-reviewed" or some other
suitable tag in Org Mode, and then unmark them as one finishes the
groom - thereby ensuring all stories get some attention. As the
product backlog becomes larger, a full groom could take multiple
sprints, but this is not an issue once you understand its value and
the cost of having it rot.</li>
<li>because the product backlog is with the code, any downtime can be
used for grooming; those idle weekends or that long wait at the
airport are perfect candidates to get a few stories looked at. Time
spent waiting for the build is also a good candidate.</li>
<li>you get an HTML representation of the Org Mode file for free in
GitHub, meaning you can read your backlog from your phone. And with
the new editing functionality, you can also edit stories too.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Thirdly, I decided to take a "multi-pass" approach at managing the
story lifecycle. These are some of the key aspects of this lifecycle
management:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>stories can only be captured if they are aligned with the
<a href="https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/vision.org">vision</a>. This filter saves me from adding all sorts of ideas which
are just too "out of the left field" to be of practical use, but
keeps <a href="https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/product_backlog.org#visionary-work-and-random-ideas">those that may sound crazy</a> are but aligned with the vision.</li>
<li>stories can only be captured if there is no "prior art". I always
perform a number of searches in the backlog to look for anything
which covers similar ground. If found, I append to that.</li>
<li>new stories tend to start with very little content - just the
minimum required to allow resetting state back to the idea I was
trying to capture. Due to this, very little gets lost. At this
point, we have a "proto-story".</li>
<li>as time progresses, I end up having more ideas on this space, and I
update the story with those ideas - mainly bullet points with one
liners and links.</li>
<li>at some point the story begins to mature; there is enough on it that
we can convert the "proto-story" to a full blown story. After a
number of grooms, the story becomes fully formed and is then a
candidate to be moved to a sprint backlog for implementation. It may
stay in this state <i>ad-infinitum</i>, with periodic updates just to
make sure it does not rot.</li>
<li>A candidate story can still get refined: trimmed in scope,
re-targeted, or even cancelled because it no longer fits with the
current architecture or even the vision. Cancelled stories are
important because we may came back to them - its just very unlikely
that we do.</li>
<li>every sprint has a "sprint mission"<label for="5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="5" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
See the <a href="https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/sprint_backlog_78.org">current sprint backlog</a> for an example.
</span>. When we start to
move stories into the sprint backlog, we look for those which
resonate with the sprint mission. Not all of them are fully formed,
and the work on the sprint can entail the analysis required to
create a full blown story. But many will be implementable directly
off of the product backlog.</li>
<li>some times I end up finding related threads in multiple stories and
decide to merge them. Merging of related stories is done by simply
copying and pasting them into a single story; over time, with the
multiple passes done in the grooms, we end up again with a single
consistent story.</li>
</ul>

<p>
What all of this means is that a story can evolve over time in the
product backlog, only to become the exact thing you need at a given
sprint; at that point you benefit from the knowledge and insight
gained over that long period of time. Some stories in Dogen's backlog
have been there for years, and when I finally get to them, I find them
extremely useful. Remember: they are a map to the unknown space you
are exploring.
</p>

<p>
With all of this machinery in place, we've ended up with a very useful
product backlog for Dogen - one that certainly adds a lot of
value. Don't take me wrong, the cost of maintenance is high and I'd
rather be coding instead of maintaining the product backlog,
especially given the limited resources. But I keep it because I can
see on a daily basis how much it improves the overall quality of the
development process. It is a price I find worth paying, given what I
get in return.

This post was an attempt to summarise some of the thoughts I've been
having on the space of product backlogs. One of its main objectives
was to try to convey the importance of this tool, and to provide ideas
on how you can improve the management of your own product backlog by
discussing the approach I have taken with Dogen.
