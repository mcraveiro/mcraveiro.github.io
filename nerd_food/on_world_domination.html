</p>

<p>
Well, three months into 2007 and very few mass migrations to desktop
Linux have been announced. A few thousands here and there, but not the
millions we all want. Its beginning to look like our hopes for 2007 as
the Linux Desktop Year (TM) have been misplaced yet again. The
algorithm for the Linux Desktop Year is becoming clear now: N + 1,
where N is the current year. Yep, its always next year. What's going
on here? Are we never going to have Linux on the desktop? Products
like Ubuntu and Novell are looking more and more solid, why aren't
people installing it en masse? What about World Domination?
</p>

<p>
Lets start by defining what we really mean by "World Domination". It
is unlikely that we will see a world where Linux has 90% of market
share across all segments, in particular on the Desktop. There's just
too big an installed based for that, and inertia is too strong. Nor
would that happen overnight, as any migration at the corporate level
can take years to plan. My personal definition of World Domination is
much more pragmatic:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For every new PC being sold, the buyer would consider whether to
install Windows or Linux, basing his or her decision on technical
and financial aspects;</li>
<li>For every migration to the latest version of Windows, the IT
department would consider migrating to Linux, basing his or her
decision on technical and financial aspects.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In other words, I want to join a company and be asked whether I want
Linux or Windows on my desktop, rather than just be given Windows and
be told to shut up. And when I go to PC World, I want to be asked if I
want Linux or Windows. A lot of people think that these things are not
happening because a) Microsoft is putting illegal pressure on vendors
to stop Linux adoption b) there are too many Linux variants so vendors
don't know what to do (DELL was a good example). Actually, whilst I
think these two factors are important, they are also very
misleading. For starters, that didn't stop Linux in other market
segments. Lets look at the recent history.
</p>

<p>
A few years ago, fifteen or so, Linux was virtually unknown in all
computing markets (call it markets, call it segments, you choose). The
mainstay of Linux support were the college dorms and the homebrew
engineers. If you were to read the articles about Linux in those days,
the few that existed, they all said that Linux would never leave the
college dorms. Not so long after that Linux became one of the most
popular platforms for ISPs and web servers in general, in partnership
with Apache. We were then told that Linux would never be more than a
platform for web-serving. Fast forward a few years more, around the
turn of the century, and we were then told that Linux would never
leave the server room. This was a time were Linux proved itself as a
good file and print server, and a good citizen on a Windows network,
all thanks to Samba. It was also the time when Linux's presence in the
clustering, super computing and the embedded markets was
consolidated. Around this time we also noticed Linux's presence in the
high end server market, in databases and proprietary server
applications. Fast forward again, now to the present time. To all
these segments we've now added POS, kiosking and other more restricted
desktop markets. We are now told that Linux will never leave the
restricted Desktop markets.
</p>

<p>
If you consider my narrower definition of world domination, then one
can say that it has been obtained in all these markets. In all of
these, people spend time looking at alternatives before settling in
Windows or Linux. In some cases Linux has got more than 50% market
share, in many other cases it has not, but there is an ongoing battle
for market share.
</p>

<p>
But let's have a closer look at the database segment, because many
lessons can be learned from it. The high end is dominated by colossus
such as DB2 and Oracle. Here Linux is extremely successful, mainly
because people don't really care about the operative system; they care
about the database product. Move over to the middle and low ends of
the market though, and Linux penetration is very small. Yes, MySQL and
PostgreSQL are making inroads, but the truth is they are yet to make a
dent in the market share of SQLServer and Access, both Microsoft
products. The same principle applies: people don't want to run
PostgreSQL, they want to run SQLServer; and since it only works on
Windows, well, that means they can only consider Windows.
</p>

<p>
The lesson to take home from all of this is simple. Linux is extremely
competitive in markets: a) that have no installed base, or where the
field moves so fast that the installed base is obsoleted quickly and
has to be replaced (embedded, clustering, supercomputing) b) that
depend only in standard protocols or protocols that can be legally
reversed engineered (file serving, web serving, authentication) c)
that depend on applications which have already been ported to Linux,
and where the port is of the same grade or higher as the original
version (Java Application Servers, SAP, Oracle, DB2, bespoke
applications, game servers) d) where there is a clone of a key
application, and the clone offers a superset of the features of the
original application, providing full compatibility e) where there is a
compatibility layer that allows Linux to run applications designed for
other platforms (.Net SWF GUI applications, Wine).
</p>

<p>
All these are pretty self explanatory, with the exception of d) and e)
so lets have a look at those.
</p>

<p>
In terms of d), I don't mean cloning here like the GIMP is a clone of
Photoshop; I mean cloning like EnterpriseDB. EnterpriseDB, the
PostgreSQL derivative which aims to be fully compatible with Oracle,
is experiencing huge growth, and the root cause of this growth is the
claimed drop-in Oracle compatibility. It appears companies are buying
the product in droves, trying to save money in Oracle licenses. In my
personal opinion, whilst the principle is brilliant, EnterpriseDB made
a mistake by going after Oracle. Most people that buy their products
have money to spare and are not worried about costs. This does not
mean there aren't many people who buy Oracle because they have to, but
the number of people in this situation is rather small. However, if
EnterpriseDB were to offer a drop-in SQLServer replacement, I am
convinced their demand would have been much higher, by many orders of
magnitude. I am talking specifically about a product that can: talk
TDS, requiring no modification from clients to connect to it; import
stored procedures, data and schemas from SQLServer with one click; be
managed from Enterprise Manager and any other SQLServer tools as if it
was another instance of SQLServer; run TSQL stored procedures without
modification. Such a product would sell a lot more because people that
buy SQLServer are much more cost sensitive than people that buy
Oracle. But the principle here is that a clone can open a lot of
doors.
</p>

<p>
As far as e) is concerned, this hasn't been proved yet because the
emulation layers are not 100% complete. The big difference between
.Net and Java is that many .Net GUI applications rely on Windows Forms
(SWF), which means they are a lot more Windows dependent. Mono is
working hard in getting a good SWF implementation, but this is a hard
task and 100% compatibility will take a while. The same can be said
for Wine, on the making for over a decade, forever getting closer but
still struggling with compatibility. IMHO, all big Linux companies
should get together and finance Wine, either through investing in
CodeWeavers or by having their own Wine developers. If Wine was able
to run <span class="underline">all</span> windows applications say up to XP, and do so smoothly,
without any problems, this would open many, many doors to Linux (and
all other operative systems with Wine). I'm not talking about "it
almost works, or it works sometimes" type of compatibility, I'm
talking about rock-solid, uncrashable, perfect, flawless support. This
will require huge amounts of investment. However, such level of
compatibility would allow IT departments to consider Linux/Windows
migration separately from the migration of Office and other key
windows applications. To migrate everything in one go is just too deep
a plunge for many people, too much risk. It's not that OpenOffice and
other applications aren't good; its just a question of reducing the
amount of change required in one go. Both approaches are good and
should be pursued, for different reasons. OpenOffice caters for a less
demanding segment of the population, Office on Wine caters for a
totally different segment.
</p>

<p>
One last rant goes for the multimedia situation. We need to have <span class="underline">all</span>
popular codecs available in Linux legally and Fluendo's work is a
significant milestone in this regard. Ubuntu is also making strides in
this department, and pragmatism is the only way to win the day
here. Don't take me wrong, there is a lot of merit in a lot of the
religious causes. OGG over MP3 any day. Software patents are evil. GNU
rules. But to create an operative system that ignores the current
state of the world and is instead designed for the world we all would
like to live in, is to doom it to failure. A case in point: last year
the basketball World Cup was on, and I desperately wanted to watch
Angola play. I then found out that the games were available on-line,
but could not get any of the existing Linux media players to work with
FIBA's website. Yes, proprietary codecs are evil but this is the World
Cup we're talking about and I'm not RMS, so I compromised. Since we
don't have anything else other than Ubuntu at home, I ended up having
to watch the games at work. Fortunately I had understanding bosses,
but is it really fair to demand this sort of commitment from the mass
market? And to shut this people from Linux is not beneficial for us
because, as we all know, critical mass is important. If Linux had 20%
of the desktop market we would get a lot more attention from hardware
companies, media websites, game developers, the world at large. They
would think about us when they release new products. Would we really
care if 19% of the 20% didn't know anything about freedom and GNU?
Would we be worse off with them on board than without? Besides, it is
a lot more likely that they would find out about freedom once they've
started using Linux. "Who are this people who give their time for free
to create such a good product?"
</p>

<p>
Forget about all the religious wars for a moment and lets put our
business hats on. The truth is, the <span class="underline">vast</span> majority of people out
there never heard about Linux. Let me tell you this, I have walked
around Africa for four months and met <span class="underline">two</span> people that heard about
Linux, and even then only vaguely. "Like Mac right?". A girl asked me
if my Debian t-shirt had anything to do with lesbians. Even in South
Africa, the home of Ubuntu, I've seen nowt, not even a single mention
of it. Not on telly, not on the shops, not on the streets, not on the
cybercafes, not on the big supermarket chains. You ask about Ubuntu on
the streets and people think you're trying to learn Zulu or Khosa and
you mean peace and unity. If we want mind share we need to be able to
be functionally equivalent to Windows, with no excuses. You have to
understand, from an outsider perspective religion <span class="underline">is</span> an excuse. You
can't really promote Linux to this people and then say "but you can't
really play proprietary media without breaking the law, and even then
it will take you days to configure". To start promoting Linux we first
need the ability to play all the popular media formats, and to do so
legally and without placing <span class="underline">any</span> configuration demands to the user
other than clicking a button. Keep in mind that when we do get to this
level, we still have a long mind share struggle to face; it will take
years to get the word out there, to get people to try.
</p>

<p>
So when are we going to get world domination?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When we can run all the popular applications faultlessly, in
particular the Windows ones, regardless how that is done (port,
emulation);</li>
<li>When we can play all the media formats flawlessly and legally;</li>
<li>When Linux is mass advertised.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We are getting close. But remeber the rule of credibility: "The first
90% of the code accounts for the first 90% of the development
time. The remaining 10% of the code accounts for the other 90% of the
development time."
