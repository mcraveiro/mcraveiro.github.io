Being in this game for the best part of twenty years, I must confess
that its not often I find something that revolutionises my coding
ways. I do tend to try a lot of things, but most of them end up
revealing themselves as fads or are incompatible with my flow. For
instance, I never managed to get [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development][BDD]] to work for me, try as I might. I
will keep trying because it sounds really useful, but it hasn't
clicked just yet.

Having said all of that, these moments of enlightenment do
occasionally happen, and when they do, nothing beats that
life-changing feeling. "Pull Request Driven Development" (or PRDD) is
my latest find. I'll start by confessing that "PRDD" as a name was
totally made up for this post and hopefully you can see its rather
tongue in cheek. However, the benefits of this approach are very
real. In fact, I've been using PRDD for a while now but I just never
really noticed its presence creeping in. Today, as I introduced a new
developer to the process, I finally had the eureka moment and saw just
how brilliant it has been thus far. It also made me realise that some
people are not aware of this great tool in the developer's arsenal.

But first things first. In order to explain what I mean by PRDD, I
need to provide a bit of context. Everyone is migrating to git these
days, even those of us locked behind corporate walls; in our
particular case, the migration path implied exposure to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stash_(software)][Git Stash]]. For
those not in the know, picture it as an expensive and somewhat less
featureful version of [[https://github.com/][GitHub]], but with most of the core functionality
there. Of course, I'm sure GitHub is not that cheap for enterprises
either, but hey at least its the tool everyone uses. Anyway -
grumbling or not - we moved to Stash and all development started to
revolve around Pull Requests (PRs), raised for each new [[https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow][feature]].

Not long after PRs were introduced, a particularly interesting habit
started to appear: developers begun opening the PRs earlier and
earlier during the feature cycle rather than waiting to the very
end. Taking this approach to the limit, the idea is that when you
start to work on a new feature, you raise the ticket and the PR
/before you write any code at all/. In practice - due to Stash's
anachronisms - you need to push at least one commit, but the general
notion is valid. This was never mandated anywhere, and there was no
particular coordination. I guess one possible explanation for this
behaviour is that one wants to get rid of the paperwork as quickly as
possible to get to the coding. At any rate, the causes may be obscure
but the emerging behaviour was not.

When you combine early PRs with the [[https://sethrobertson.github.io/GitBestPractices/][commit early and commit often]]
approach - which you should be using anyway - the PR starts to become
a living document; people see your development work as it progresses
and they start commenting on it and possibly even sending you patches
/as you go along/. In a way, this is an enabler for a very efficient
kind of peer programming - particularly if you have a tightly knit
team - because it gives you maximum parallelism but in a very subtle,
non-noticeable way. The main author of the PR is coding as she would
normally be, but whenever there is a lull in development - those
moments where you'd be browsing the web for five minutes or so - you
can quickly check for any comments on your PR and react to
those. Similarly, other developers can carry on doing their own work
and browse the PRs on their downtime; this allows them to provide
feedback whenever it is convenient /to them/, and to choose the format
of the feedback - lengthy or quick, as time permits.

Quick feedback is many a times invaluable in large code bases because
everyone tends to know their own little corner of the code and only
very few old hands know how it all hangs together. Thus, seemingly
trivial one liners such as "have you considered using API xyz instead
of rolling your own" or "don't forget to do abc when you do that"
could save you /many/ hours of pain and enable knowledge to be
transferred organically - something that no number of wiki pages could
hope to achieve in a million years because its very difficult to find
these pearls in a sea of uncurated content. And because you committed
early and often, each commit is very small and very easy to parse in a
small interval of time, so people are much more willing to review - as
opposed to that several Kb (or even Mb!) patch that you will have to
allocate a day or two for. Further: if you [[http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/][take your commit message
seriously]] - as, again, you should - you will find that the number of
reviewers will grow rapidly simply because developers are nosy and
opinionated.

Note that this review process involves no vague meetings and no
lengthy and unfocused email chains; it is very high-quality because it
is (or can be) very focused to specific lines of code; it causes no
unwanted disruptions because you review where and when you choose to
review; reviewers can provide examples and even fix things themselves
if they so choose; it is totally inclusive because anyone who wants to
participate can, but no one is forced to; and it equalises local and
remote developers because they all have access to the same data
(modulus some IRL conversations that always take place) - an important
feature in this world of near-shoring, off-shoring and
home-working. Most importantly, instead of finding out some
fundamental errors of approach at the end of an intense period of
coding, you now have timely feedback. This saves an /enormous/ amount
of time - an advantage that anyone who has been through lengthy code
reviews and then spent a week or two reacting to that feedback can
appreciate.

I am now a believer in PRDD. So much so that whenever I go back to
work on legacy projects in svn, I find myself cringing all the way to
the end of the feature. It just feels so nineties.
