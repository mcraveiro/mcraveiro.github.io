<p>
It is very difficult to convey the vast scale at which the largest
Internet companies operate. To make matters worse, we are fast
becoming immune to statistics such as one billion users and five
trillion searches per day, surrounded as we are by a sea of large
numbers on a daily basis. Having said that, any Information Technology
(IT) professional worth his or her salt cannot help but feel in awe at
what has been achieved. It is not just that these platforms are big;
they work at a scale that is qualitatively different from anything
that has come before. The sort of things that are possible at this
scale are mind-boggling, and we have only begun to scratch the
surface<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
As one of many examples, see Google Flu Trends. It is a
predictor of outbreaks of the flu virus, with a prediction rate of
about 97%. For a more comprehensive - if somewhat popular - take on
the possibilities of large data sets, see Big Data: A Revolution That
Will Transform How We Live, Work and Think. For a very different
take - highliting the dangers of Big Data - see Taleb's views on the
ever decreasing noise to signal ratio: The Noise Bottleneck or How
Noise Explodes Faster than Data.
</span>.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps even more revolutionary is the fact that these companies have
made it possible for anyone to start thinking about data in the same
way as they do, and to start handling it using the very same tools
they use. There is now a never-ending archive of the very best
large-scalability tools, all available for free, with code that anyone
can inspect, modify and optimise to meet their specific
requirements. The tools come with a wealth of practical documentation
on how to put solutions together - either freely available or at
low-cost - and with a number of passionate user communities that
provide expert advice and are eager to accept modifications.
</p>

<p>
The ecosystem they have created is truly staggering. As an example,
Facebook has open sourced almost 10M lines of code to date. Twitter,
Google and LinkedIn are not far behind<label for="2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
In fact, by some measures, Google has contributed several times
that amount. For one such take, see Lauren Orsini's article.
</span>. It is also important to
notice that non-Internet companies are making extremely large
contributions too, such as Microsoft and IBM. All told, the overall
pool of open source code is growing exponentially, as demonstrated by
a 2008 study. In most cases, these are full-fledged products, tested
in the most challenging production conditions imaginable. Of course,
one must also not forget the contributions made to projects that are
not under company control such as the Linux Kernel, the Apache
web-server and the GNU Compiler GCC.
</p>

<p>
In order to understand why modern start-ups provide such a compelling
financial case, one must first understand how we got to the amazing
technology landscape we have today. To do so, we shall divide recent
technology history into eras, and explain each era's contribution. We
will then focus on modern start-ups, and explain how this model can be
deployed to a large gamut of industries and in particular to the
financial sector.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org5bba5ef" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org5bba5ef">First Era: Dot-com Bubble</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5bba5ef">
<p>
Silicon Valley was and still is the world's start-up factory so,
unsurprisingly, it was ground zero for the start-up revolution that
took place at the end of the nineties. It would eventually be known as
The Dot-com Bubble. Most people remember those days as a heady time,
where each and every idea was packaged as a website and sold for
millions or in some cases billions of dollars. Of course, we all had a
steep price to pay when the bubble burst - an extinction event that
decimated the young Internet sector and IT companies in general.
</p>

<p>
There is however another way to look at this bubble: it was a gigantic
experiment to determine whether there were successful business models
to be found in the large scale of the Internet. Whilst much
mal-investment occurred, the bubble still produced or pushed forward
several of the giants of today such as Google, Amazon and Yahoo.
</p>

<p>
Most of these companies share a similar technology story. Originally
faced with a dearth of investment but with bright young engineers,
they found themselves relying on Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
and cheap, off-the shelf hardware. Once they became big enough, it
just didn't make sense to replace all of that infrastructure with
software and hardware supplied by commercial vendors.
</p>

<p>
This turn of events was crucial. If these companies had had larger
budgets and less skilled engineers, they would have relied on the
cutting edge technology of the time. The short-term gain would reveal
itself as long term pain, for their ability to scale would be
inevitably restricted. In addition, many of the business models
wouldn't have worked due to this cost structure<label for="3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
3 As an example, it was common practice for vendors to charge
according to the number of processors, users and so on. Many of the
better funded start-ups made use of technology from Cisco, Sun, Oracle
and other large commercial vendors, but companies that did so are not
very well represented in the population that survived the dot-com
bubble, and they are not represented at all in the 2014 Fortune 500
list. Google, Amazon and E-Bay are the only Fortune 500 companies from
that crop and they all relied to a very large extent on in-house
technology. Note though that we are making an empirical argument here
rather than a statistical one, both due to the lack of data available,
as well as concern for Survivorship Bias.
</span>. As it was,
since they couldn't even afford the relatively cheap licences of
commercial software, they had to make do with what was available for
free.
</p>

<p>
The engineers in these companies - and many others that didn't make it
through the dot-com filter - spent countless hours improving FOSS
tools and gave back much of these improvements to communities such as
Linux, MySQL, Apache, GCC and so on. However, they kept private the
plumbing work done to manage the large cluster of cheap machines, as
well as the domain related technology - in industry-speak, the Secret
Sauce.
</p>

<p>
By the time the dot-com bubble had run its course and the dust
settled, the landscape looked as follows:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A model had been created whereby a small number of engineers could
bootstrap an Internet-based company at very low cost, serving a
small number of users initially.</li>
<li>The model had been stretched to very large numbers of users and had
been found to scale extremely well; as the business proved itself
and investment came in, it was possible increase the size of the
computing infrastructure to cope with demand.</li>
<li>Because of the open nature of the technologies involved, the ideas
became widespread over the internet.</li>
<li>The basic high-scalability FOSS stack - ready for start-ups - was
born; the Data Centre, where large amounts of computing are
available at low cost, soon followed. It would eventually morph into
the Cloud.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb4cd8b1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb4cd8b1">Second Era: Social Media</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb4cd8b1">
<p>
The bursting of the dot-com bubble did not dampen the entrepreneurial
spirits, but it did dry up all the easily available capital and thus
pushed the aspiring start-ups to be ever more frugal. In addition, VCs
started to look for better ways to evaluate prospects. The problem
they faced was no different from what they had faced during the
dot-com days: how to figure out the potential of a company with no
defined business model and nothing else to compare it against.
</p>

<p>
Google had proved comprehensively that the traditional valuation
methods did not make sense in the world of start-ups. After all, here
was a company which it's founders couldn't sell for 1M USD and yet a
few years later was generating billions of dollars in revenues. Very
few saw this coming. VCs were keen not to make the same mistake with
the next Google<label for="4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
For one of many takes on the attempt to sell Google, see When
Google Wanted To Sell To Excite For Under 1 Million~— And They
Passed. To get a flavour of how poorly understood Google's future was
as late as 2000, see Google Senses That It's Time to Grow Up. Finally,
the success story is best told by the growth of revenues between 2001
and 2003 - see Google's 2003 Financial Tables.
</span>.
</p>

<p>
So it was that a system to determine potential by proxy emerged over
the years, using indicators such as the size of the user base, time
spent by users on the platform and so on - effectively, any attribute
that was deemed to have given a competitive advantage to Google and
other successful dot-com companies.
</p>

<p>
In this environment, social media start-ups took took centre
stage. Following on from the examples of their predecessors, these
companies took for granted that they were to operate on very large
data sets. They inherited a very good set of scalable tools, but found
that much still had to be built on top. Unlike their predecessors,
many chose to do some or all of the infrastructure work out in the
open, joining or creating new communities around the tools. This was
in no small part due to the scarcity of funds, which encouraged
collaboration.
</p>

<p>
The social media start-ups soon found themselves locked in an arms
race for size, where the biggest would be the winner and all others
would be doomed to irrelevance<label for="5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="5" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn and the like were the
victors, but for every victor, a worthwhile foe was defeated; MySpace,
Hi5, Orkut and many others were all very popular at one time but lost
the war and faded into obscurity.
</span>. The size of the user base of the
successful companies exploded<label for="6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="6" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
As an example, the number of Facebook users grew at an
exponential rate between 2004 and 2013 - see Facebook: 10 years of
social networking, in numbers.
</span>, and the tooling required to
manage such incredibly large volumes of data had to improve at the
same pace or faster. Interestingly, these start-ups continued to view
in-house code largely as a cost, not an asset, even after they started
to bring in large revenue. The size of the secret sauce was to be kept
at a minimum and the pace of open sourcing accelerated over
time<label for="7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="7" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
A possible explanation for this decision is the need for
continuous scalability. Even companies as large as Facebook or Google
cannot dedicate the resources required to adequately maintain every
single tool they own; their code bases are just too large. At the same
time, they cannot afford for code to become stale because it must
continually withstand brutal scalability challenges. The solution to
this conundrum was to open source aggressively and to create vibrant
communities around tooling. Converting themselves to stewards of the
tools, they could now place quasi-skeleton crews to give direction to
development, and then rely on the swarms of new start-ups to
contribute patches. Once there are enough improvements, the latest
version of these tools can be incorporated into the internal
infrastructure. This proved to be a very cost-effective strategy, even
for large companies, and allowed continued investment across the
technology stack.
</span>.
</p>

<p>
A final factor was the rise of the next iteration of the data centre,
popularised by Amazon with AWS and EC2. It allowed any company to
scale out without ever having to concern themselves with physical
hardware. This was revolutionary because it allowed razor-thin costs
for scalability:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Pay only for what you use</b>: the elastic nature of EC2 meant that
one could grow or shrink one's cluster based on real time traffic
demands and availability of capital.</li>
<li><b>Zero-cost software</b>: FOSS was available in Amazon from the very
beginning and was extremely popular with start-ups.</li>
<li><b>Fully automated environments via APIs</b>: resource constrained
start-ups could now start to automate all aspects of the product
life-cycle. This meant they could release faster, which in turn
allowed them to fight more effectively for their user base. This
would in time become the DevOps movement.</li>
</ul>

<p>
By the end of the decade, the scalability tooling was largely
complete. It was now possible for a small start-up to create a small
website and to see it scale from hundreds to millions, restricted only
by their ability to bring in capital.

<h2 id="orgc898a35">Third Era: Mobile</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc898a35">
<p>
Mobile phones have been growing close to an exponential rate for over
two decades. However, the rise of the smart phones was a game changer,
and the line in the sand was drawn with the release of the
iPhone. What makes mobile so important to our story is it's
penetration. Until smart phones became ubiquitous, there was a large
segment of the population that was either totally inaccessible or
accessible for limited periods of time. With increasingly large
numbers of people carrying smart phones as they go about their day,
many use cases that were never before thought possible came to the
table. So whilst we call this "the Mobile era", the true heroes are
smart phones and, to a smaller extent, the tablets.
</p>

<p>
The mobile era started with simple apps. Smart phones were still new
and applications for each platform were novelty. There was a need to
reinvent all that existed before in the world of PCs and adapt it to
the new form factor. It was during this phase that the economies of
scale of mobile phones became obvious. Whereas consumer PC software
had prices on the range of tens to hundreds of dollars, mobile phones
bootstrapped a completely different pricing model, with many apps
selling for less than one dollar. Volume made up for the loss in
revenue per unit. The model was so incredibly successful that a
vibrant environment of apps sprung up around each of the successful
platforms, carefully nurtured by the companies running the show via
their app stores.
</p>

<p>
Soon enough the more complex apps came about. Companies like Four
Square and WhatsApp were trailblazers in the mobile space, merging it
with ideas from social media. Many others like Spotify took their
wares from the stagnant PC environment and moved to the ever growing
mobile space. Complex apps differed from the simple apps in that they
required large backends to manage operations. Since these companies
were cash strapped - a perennial condition of all start-ups - they
found themselves reusing all of the technology developed by the social
media companies and became part of the exact same landscape. Of
course, the social media companies were eventually forced to jump on
the mobile bandwagon - lest they got crushed by it.
</p>

<p>
So it was that the circle was closed between the three eras.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge73b1a7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge73b1a7">Evolutionary Pressures and Auto-Catalytic Processes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge73b1a7">
<p>
The changes just described are so revolutionary that one cannot help
but look for models to approximate some kind of explanation for what
took place. Two stand out. The first is to imagine the population of
start-up companies as a small segment of the overall company
population that was submitted to an unbelievably harsh fitness
function: to grow the data volumes exponentially while growing costs
less than linearly. This filter generated new kinds of companies, new
kinds of technologies and new kinds of ways of managing technology.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, there is the auto-catalytic nature of the processes that
shaped the current technology landscape. Exponential growth tends to
have at its root this kind of self-reinforcing cycle, whereby
improvements in an area A trigger improvements in another area B,
which in turn forces A to improve. The process keeps on repeating
itself whilst it manages to retain stability.
</p>

It is this relationship we currently have between start-ups and FOSS:
the better the software gets, the cheaper it is to create new
start-ups and the faster these can grow with the same amount of
capital. By the same token, the more start-ups rely on FOSS, the more
they find themselves contributing back or else risk falling behind -
both technologically and cost-wise. This feedback loop is an emerging
property of the entire system and it has become extremely pronounced
over time.

<h2 id="orgd5f22e9">Finance and the Age of Disruption</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd5f22e9">
<p>
The concept of disruption was developed in the nineties by Clayton
Christensen in Innovator's Dilemma. This book has seen a resurgence in
popularity as well as in criticism<label for="8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="8" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
8 There are quite a few to choose from but Lepore's is one of
the best because it robustly attacks both the ideology and the quality
of the data.
</span>. For good or bad, the ideas
in this book became the intellectual underpinnings of a new generation
of start-ups.
</p>

<p>
They seek to combine all of the advances of the previous start-ups to
create solutions to problems far outside the traditional IT
realm. Examples are the hotel industry (AirBnB), the taxi industry
(Uber, Lyft) and even the banking industry (Simple). Whilst it's still
early days, and whilst there have been many teething problems such as
issues with regulation, the destination of travel is already clear:
there will be more and more start-ups following the disruptive route.
</p>

<p>
What makes these companies a compelling proposition to VCs is that
they are willing to take on established concerns, with cost structures
that are orders of magnitude larger than that of these
start-ups. Their thinking is two-fold: the established companies are
leaving a lot of money on the table, consumed by their inefficiency;
and they are not exploiting the opportunities to their full potential
because they do not understand how to operate at a vast scale.
</p>

<p>
It is in this context that finance scene comes into the picture - as
part of the expansionary movement of the disruption movement. VCs have
longed eyed enviously the financial industry because they believed
that the problems being solved in trading are not that dissimilar to
those faced by many large scale start-ups. And yet the rewards are
disproportional large in Finance, when compared with say social media.
</p>

<p>
Fintech soon emerged. As applied to start-ups, Fintech is the umbrella
name given to the ecosystem of start-ups and VCs that focus
specifically on financial technology. This ecosystem has grown from
930M USD in 2008 to around 3Bn in 2013 according to Accenture. Centred
mainly in London, but with smaller offshoots in other financial
centres, the Fintech scene is starting to attract established players
in the world of Finance. For instance, Barclays has joined the fray by
creating an incubator. They farmed off the work to a third-party (Tech
Stars) but allowed all the start-ups in the programme to have
unprecedented access to their Mobile APIs. Their target is to own the
next generation of financial applications on Mobile devices.
</p>

<p>
Whist Barclays is disrupting from the outside, it is obvious that the
investment banking legacy platforms are a fertile ground for
start-ups. This is where the scalability stack has a near-perfect
fit. A typical example is OpenGamma. The start-up designed an open
source Risk platform, initially focused on back office use. They have
received over 20M USD in funding as of 2014 and have already been the
recipient of several of the industry's awards. There are now several
open source trading platforms to choose from including TradeLink and
OpenGamma, as well as the popular quantitative analytics library
QuantLib.
</p>

<p>
As we have seen in the previous sections, there is an auto-catalytic
process at play here. Once source code becomes widely available, the
cost of creating the next Financial startup goes down dramatically
because they can reuse the tools. This in turn means many more
start-ups will emerge, thus improving the general quality of the
publicly available source code.

<h2 id="orgfdfb964">Conclusions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfdfb964">
<p>
The objective of this article was to provide a quick survey of the
impact of start-up companies in the technology landscape, and how
these relate to finance. We now turn our attention to the logical
conclusions of these developments.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Finance will increasingly be the target of VCs and start-ups: The
Fintech expansion is to continue over the coming years and it will
affect everyone involved in the industry, particularly the
established participants. More companies will take the route of
Barclays, trying to be part of the revolution rather than dethroned
by it.</li>
<li>Banks and other established companies will begin to acquire
start-ups: Related to the previous item in some ways; but also with
a twist. As part of the Deloitte TMT predictions event, Greg
Rogers - the manager of Barclays Accelerator - stated that the
acquisition of non-financial start-ups by banks was on the cards. He
was speaking about Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp for 18Bn USD,
one of the largest of the year. As Google and Facebook begin
integrating payments into their social platforms, banking firms will
find their traditional business models under attack and will have no
option but to retaliate.</li>
<li>Finance will turn increasingly to FOSS: The cost structure that
finance firms had up to 2008 is not suitable to the post 2008
world. At present, the volume of regulatory work is allowing these
cost structures to persist (and in cases increase). However,
eventually banks will have to face reality and dramatically reduce
their costs, in line with the new kind of revenues they are expected
to make in a highly-regulated financial world. There will be a
dramatic shift away from proprietary technologies of traditional
vendors, unless these become much more competitive against their
fierce FOSS rivals.</li>
<li>A FOSS financial stack will emerge over the next five years:
Directly related to the previous point, but taking it further. Just
as it was with social media companies, so it seems likely that
financial firms will eventually realise that they cannot afford to
maintain all the infrastructure code. Once an investment bank takes
the leap and starts relying on FOSS for trading or back-office, the
change will ripple through the industry. The state of the FOSS code
is production ready, and a number of hedge funds are already using
it in anger. All that is required is for the cost structure to be
squeezed even further in the investment banking sector.</li>

3 As an example, it was common practice for vendors to charge
according to the number of processors, users and so on. Many of the
better funded start-ups made use of technology from Cisco, Sun, Oracle
and other large commercial vendors, but companies that did so are not
very well represented in the population that survived the dot-com
bubble, and they are not represented at all in the 2014 Fortune 500
list. Google, Amazon and E-Bay are the only Fortune 500 companies from
that crop and they all relied to a very large extent on in-house
technology. Note though that we are making an empirical argument here
rather than a statistical one, both due to the lack of data available,
as well as concern for Survivorship Bias.

A possible explanation for this decision is the need for
continuous scalability. Even companies as large as Facebook or Google
cannot dedicate the resources required to adequately maintain every
single tool they own; their code bases are just too large. At the same
time, they cannot afford for code to become stale because it must
continually withstand brutal scalability challenges. The solution to
this conundrum was to open source aggressively and to create vibrant
communities around tooling. Converting themselves to stewards of the
tools, they could now place quasi-skeleton crews to give direction to
development, and then rely on the swarms of new start-ups to
contribute patches. Once there are enough improvements, the latest
version of these tools can be incorporated into the internal
infrastructure. This proved to be a very cost-effective strategy, even
for large companies, and allowed continued investment across the
technology stack.
