<p>
When it comes to programming, for me there isn't much of a choice: the
place to be is the server side. I may work a lot on the client side
these days, but GUIs and chrome never had much of an attraction for
me. I do have a healthy dose of respect for those who love it: client
side work is a mixture of coding mastery, design skills and a big
dollop of human psychology. For some reason when I visualise the
client side I always imagine nice, pristine offices with lots of light
and huge amounts of human interaction between programmers as well as
between programmers and users.
</p>

<p>
The server side is a totally different beast. I always visualise it as
the dark place of green terminals and server rooms, of never ending
performance charts and monitor applications, the land of blinken
lights. Of course, these days we all have to share the same desks and
deal with the same layers of managerial PHBs - and with HR and their
latest social experiments - but the fundamental point is that these
are two very different crafts.
</p>

<p>
Thing is, I find that the server side is extremely misunderstood
because the vast majority of developers out there come from a client
background. When developers cross over, their bias introduces many,
many problems on server side applications, simply because they are not
used to the server way of thinking.
</p>

<p>
This article covers many mistakes I've seen over the years, in the
hope you may avoid them, offering some tentative solutions.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgff57abc" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgff57abc">The Languages</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgff57abc">
<p>
There really is only one language to do server side work: C++. Yes,
I'm a zealot. Yes, I know that both .Net and Java are much easier to
get along with, and have none of the tricky memory allocation problems
that riddle C++ applications (those that haven't discovered shared
pointers, at any rate). I agree that, in theory, both Java and C# are
better options. In practice, however, they become problematic.
</p>

<p>
The right staff. It's difficult to find a got Java/C# programmer, just
like it was difficult to find a good VB programmer. The client side is
a very forgiving land, and not only can bad programmers get away with
it for years but you also have to remember that great client side
programmers don't need to know their tools to the level of detail that
server side programmers do. How many times do you need to read up on
scheduling to do a GUI? Or on TCP flags? Not often, I'd wager. So the
reality is, if you have been doing any of these languages for a while,
you can talk all the right TLAs and describe all the right concepts
with easiness and fly through most interviews. But when it comes to
doing the job, you will probably be reading manuals for days trying to
figure out which subset of technologies on your stack are good for
server side and which ones are just plain evil performance killers. A
good server side Java/C# programmer will use only the smallest set of
features of the language when programming, knowing exactly the cost of
those features.
</p>

<p>
It is, of course, really hard to find a good C++ programmer too. But
here, there are two things that help us. There are not that many left
doing C++ work - most of them have migrated to higher pastures by now,
in particular those that always felt uncomfortable with the
language. The few that are left are doing server side work. The second
thing is, due to C++'s lower level of abstraction, even a bad C++
programmer is well aware of the bare metal. It basically forces you to
think harder, rather than just pickup a manual and copy an example.
</p>

<p>
Minimise layers of indirection. Another problem I have with Java/C# is
indirection, which is another way of saying performance. Now, I know
all you Java and .Net heads have many benchmarks proving how your AOT
compilers optimise on the fly and make them even faster than native
code, or how your VM is much better at understanding application's run
time behaviour and optimising itself for it. And the fact that you
never worry about memory leaks goes without saying. Well, that's all
fine and dandy as far as the lab is concerned.
</p>

<p>
What I found out on the field is different. Resource allocation is
still a massive problem, either due to complex cyclical referencing,
or just plain programmer incompetence. Memory consumption is massive,
because programmers don't really understand the costs involved in
using APIs, and thus just use whatever is easier. This, of course,
also impacts performance badly. And to make things even worse, you
then have to deal with the non-deterministic behaviour of the VM. It's
bad enough not knowing what the kernel will decide and when, but when
you put in a VM - and god forbid, an application server! - then its
nigh impossible. It could be a VM bug. Or it could be that you are not
using certain API properly. Or it's just your complex code. Or it's
the OS's fault. Who knows. That's when you have to fork out mega-bucks
and pay an expensive Java/.Net consultant to sort it all out. And pray
he/she knows what he/she is talking about.
</p>

<p>
The truth is, I've never heard of a Java/.Net application on the field
that was found to be more performant than it's C++ counterpart. In
part, this is because we are comparing apples with oranges - the
rewrites seldom cover the same functionality, adding large amounts of
new features and making straight comparisons impossible. But there
must be more to it too, since, from experience, Java/.Net engineers
seem to spend an inordinate amount of time trying to improve
performance.
</p>

<p>
Now, before you go and start rewriting your apps in C++, keep this in
mind: the biggest decision factor in deciding a language is the
competence of your staff. If you have a Java/.Net house, and you ain't
going to hire, don't use C++. It will only lead to tears and
frustration, and in the end you will conclude C++ is crap. If you are
really serious about C++, you will need a team of very strong,
experienced C++ developers leading the charge. If you haven't got
that, best use whatever language you are most competent at.
</p>

<p>
Another very important thing to keep in mind is the greatest C++
shortcoming: its small standard class library. It is perhaps the
language's biggest problem (and probably the biggest reason for
Java/c#'s success). This means you either end up writing things from
scratch, buying a third party product (vendor lock-in) or using one or
several open source products, each with their own conventions, styles,
etc. At present Boost is a must have in any C++ shop, but it does not
cover the entire problem domain of server side development. These are
the following things to look for in any library:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Networking</li>
<li>Database access</li>
<li>Threading</li>
<li>Logging</li>
<li>Configuration</li>
<li>Serialisation</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0506375" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org0506375">The Hardware Platform</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0506375">
<p>
As far as the client side is concerned, platform is almost a
non-issue: you will most likely only support Windows on x86. After
all, Linux and Mac are so far behind in terms of market share it's not
even funny. The cautious developer will point out that a Web
application is a safer bet, although you may loose much richness due
to the limitations of the technology. AJAX is nice, but not quite the
same as a solid GUI. If kiosks and POS are some or all of your target
market, you will be forced to look at cross-platform since Linux is
making inroads in this market. And you can always use Java.
</p>

<p>
With regards to the server side, one must look at the world in a
totally different light. Because you never know what your scalability
requirements are, there is no such thing as an ideal hardware
platform. Today, one 32-bit Windows server with 2 processors and 4
gigs or RAM may be more than enough; tomorrow you may need to run apps
that require 20 gigs of RAM and 16 processors, and big iron is your
only option.
</p>

<p>
So the most important aspect in terms of the hardware platform is
this: whatever you do, <span class="underline">never</span> commit yourself to one. Write a
cross-platform application from the start, and ensure it remains
one. Even on a Windows only shop, it's not hard to use a
cross-platform toolkit and have a PowerPC Linux box on the side to run
tests on. Its actually not much harder to write cross-platform <span class="underline">server
side</span> code, as long as you have a library you can trust to abstract
things properly. And as long as you take cross-platform testing
seriously.
</p>

<p>
Think of it as an insurance policy. One day, when your boss asks you
for a 10-fold increase in deal volume, you know you can always run to
the shop and buy some really, really big boxen to do the job. Tying
yourself to an hardware platform is like putting all of your eggs in
one basket; better not drop it.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc9f3ed7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgc9f3ed7">The Architecture</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc9f3ed7">
<p>
The single most important lesson to learn on the server side is that
architecture is everything. No server side project should start
without first having a top notch architect, known to have built at
least two large scale systems. You can always do it on the cheap, save
the money and get more programmers instead, but remember: you will pay
the cost later. Things would be different if maintenance was taken
seriously; but don't kid yourself, it's not.
</p>

<p>
When the business suddenly tells you that you need to double up
capacity, or support Asia and America, or add some products that are
radically different from the ones your system now processes - that's
when you'll feel the pain. And that's when you'll have to start
designing v2.0 of your system, starting mainly from scratch.
</p>

<p>
One of the key differences between client side and server side work is
this focus on scalability. After all, there is only so much work a
single person can do, so many simultaneous instances of a client side
application that can be started on any one machine, and so many trades
that can be loaded into a single PC. Not so with the server side. You
may think that processing N trades is more than enough, but that is
today; tomorrow, who knows, 10xN could be the average.
</p>

<p>
A good architect will probably look at the problem and find ways to
distribute it. That is, to design a very large number of small,
well-defined servers, each of which with a small subset of
responsibilities - all talking to each other over a messaging bus of
some kind. The system will use a narrow point of access to the
database, and huge amounts of caching on each server. This will allow
the system to scale as demand grows, just by adding more
servers. Hardware is cheap; software engineers are expensive.
</p>

<p>
The ideal architect will also be clever enough to allow client tools
to be written on Java or C#, and let someone with more experience on
these matters lead its development.
</p>

<p>
In summary, the key components of a system will be along these lines:
A solid, cross-platform, scalable relational database. Oracle and
Sybase are likely candidates, and PostgreSQL on the free software side
of things; A solid, cross-platform, scalable messaging bus. Tibco,
Talarian, etc. Choose something you have experience with. Never, ever,
under any circumstances write your own. (at present, I'm not aware of
any free software alternatives for messaging); A large number of small
servers, communicating over the messaging bus.  Getting the
architecture right is essential; but once you're there, you must work
hard to maintain it.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orge9e2ab1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge9e2ab1">The Database</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge9e2ab1">
<p>
Just as you need an architect, you also need a DBA. You may be a
hotshot when it comes to databases, you think, but the truth is a good
DBA will take your optimal code and optimise it ten times
over. Minimum. It's what they do for a living. It's important to get
the DBA early into the system design process to ensure no crass
mistakes are made on the early stages. These are much harder to fix
afterwards. And make sure the schema is designed by him/her, with
large input from developers - minimising the impedance mismatch
between the C++ datamodel and the database schema.
</p>

<p>
If your DBA hasn't got the bandwidth to write all the stored procs
directly, at least make sure he/she sets down the guide lines on how
to write the stored procs, and if at all possible reviews code before
check-ins.
</p>

<p>
You should also create a repeatable testing framework for performance
on all procs, to detect quickly when somebody makes a change that
impacts performance. But a good DBA will tell you all about it, and
many things more.

<h2 id="org6cbd0ed">A Catalogue of Mistakes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6cbd0ed">
<p>
There are many small mistakes to be found on server side apps, some at
the architectural level, others at the implementation. This is a
summary of a few I've seen over the years.
</p>

<p>
<b>Overusing XML</b>. Whilst XML is a brilliant technology to enable
cross-platform communication, and it has many benefits for client side
development, it is of very limited usage on the server side. Pretty
much the only things it should be considered for are: Allow Java /
.Net clients to talk to the server side; Allow external parties to
send data into our system; Save the configuration settings for
servers.  It should not be used for anything else. (And even then, you
should still think really hard about each of these cases). It
certainly should not be used for communication between servers within
the server side, nor should it be used, god forbid, in any kind of way
within the database. De-serialising XML in a stored proc is an
aberration of server side nature.
</p>

<p>
Bear in mind the following XML constraints: The vast majority of the
message is redundant information, making messages unnecessarily
large. This will clog up your pipes, and have particularly nasty
effects in terms of throughput on high-latency links (any large
message will).  XML messages normally have associated a schema or
DTD. Servers that you yourself wrote will use the same serialisation
code, so there shouldn't be any need to validate these messages
against a DTD/schema (you will of course have some sanity checks on
C++).  Serialising and de-serialising from XML is horrendously
expensive. In particular, if all your servers are running on the same
hardware platform, there are absolutely no benefits - and the costs
are massive.  Compressed XML is a solution in need of a problem. You
may save costs on transport, but these have been transferred to an
intensive CPU bound process (decompressing and compressing).  In
conclusion, XML is not cheap. As your deal volumes increase, you will
find that you're spending more and more of your absolute time
transporting, serialising, de-serialising and validating. It's fine
for one-offs, for sure, but not for volume.
</p>

<p>
The only type of serialisation permitted on the server room is binary
serialisation. You can make it cross-platform using something along
the lines of XDR or X.409.
</p>

<p>
The lesson we learn from XML is applicable everywhere else on the
server side: always evaluate cautiously a technology and make sure you
fully understand its costs - in particular with regards to increases
in volume.
</p>

<p>
XML is a brilliant technology, and fit for purpose; that purpose is
not efficiency.
</p>

<p>
<b>Cool technologies</b>. If you didn't listen to my point on how C++ is
the only option and insisted in using Java or C# - or, god forbid, you
found a way of doing it in C++ - you may have started using
reflection. This, and many other technologies are utterly forbidden on
the server side.
</p>

<p>
Very much like XML, the problem with such technologies is that in 99%
of cases they are used to solve problems that never existed in the
first place. I mean, do you really need to dynamically determine the
database driver you are going to use? How often do you change
relational database providers without making any code changes? Of
course, those calls would be cached, but still, it's the principle
that matters. And does it really help application design to determine
at run-time which method to call, and its parameters and their types?
This is several orders of magnitude more expensive than virtual
functions. Does it really make coding any simpler? Because the cost is
huge, and the scalability is poor. If you are using reflection because
there is large amount of repetitive code, which can be factored out
with reflection, consider using a text processing language to generate
the repetitive code. This is a clean, maintainable and performant
solution.
</p>

<p>
Another pet peeve are components and distributed technologies. Do you
really need complex technologies such as (D)COM and CORBA? Components
are nice in theory, but in reality they add huge amounts of
maintenance problems, configuration costs, debugging becomes much
harder and performance is hindered in mysterious ways.
</p>

<p>
In the vast majority of cases, you can create your own little
messaging layer in extremely simple C++ - code that anyone understands
and can debug in seconds - built on top of a serialisation framework
such as Boost.Serialisation. Whilst Boost.Serialisation is not the
most performant of them all, nor does it have great support for
cross-platform binary serialisation, it is good enough for a large
number of cases; and you can extend its binary serialisation to fit
your needs.
</p>

<p>
The server side is not the place to experiment. Cool and hip are
bad. Pretty much all technologies that are required to make
large-scale, scalable applications have been invented decades ago -
they just need to be used properly. When choosing a server side
technology, always go down the proven path.
</p>

<p>
Performance testing. One thing many people do is to create servers
that can only be loaded up from a database or another server, and can
only send their results to a database or another server. This is a
crushing limitation, introduced for no reason other than laziness or
bad project planning ("test tools? no time for them!"). The whole
point of server side development is to be able to offer guarantees in
terms of scalability. Those guarantees can only be offered if there is
a reliable way of stress testing your components independently, and
create a baseline of such tests so that regressions can be found
quickly.
</p>

<p>
Having to setup an entire environment to test a given server is not
just troublesome, it hinders fault isolation. It may also mean that
there are only a few test systems available. Each developer should be
able to have their own development environment.
</p>

<p>
Of course, don't take me wrong: one should have system-wide
performance tests; but these are only relevant if all components
passed their individual load tests.
</p>

<p>
<b>GUI tools</b>. One thing you should consider from the beginning is the
ecosystem of GUI tools that are required to manage your system,
ideally written in a high-level language such as Java/C#. Here, in the
vast majority of cases, usability is more important than performance,
and this is where Java/C# are at their best.
</p>

<p>
The GUI tools should focus on things like: Account administration:
adding new users, deleting them, etc.  Monitoring and diagnostics:
graphs on deal volume, health checks to ensure servers are still
alive, memory usage, cpu usage.  Maintenance, deployment,
configuration: restarting servers when they die, easy deployment and
configuration of servers.  Data administration: special functions to
perform on the data to resolve cases where duff data was inserted,
etc. This is sort of a client for power users.  The biggest problem of
not having a good ecosystem of GUI management tools is that your
development work will became more and more operational, since the
system is too complex to give it to real operators.
</p>

<p>
<b>Database Serialisation</b>. This is one of the most important aspects of
any server side system, and has to be carefully thought out. You
should keep it to a bare minimum the number of servers that touch the
database directly, and make sure they are physically located as close
as possible to the database - but no closer; never on the same
machine. All other servers must go to these data servers to read and
write to the database.
</p>

<p>
The second important point is to try to "automate" the serialisation
as much as possible. All objects that are serialisable to the database
should have auto-generated code (never reflection!) responsible for
reading/writing the data. They should also interface with the database
via stored procs - never reading tables directly - all making sensible
use of transactions.
</p>

<p>
Keep it simple and Know Your Costs. Optimal code is normally very
simple; sub-optimal code is non-performant due to its complexity. This
simple truism underlies very much all performance work. It's very rare
that one needs to increase complexity to improve performance. In the
majority of cases, the easiest way is to ask the simple question: do
we really need to do this? And when you decide you really need to do
something, make sure you are fully aware of its O cost. Choosing a
O(N) approach (or worse) should never be taken lightly because it's a
scalability time bomb and it will always blow up when you need it the
least - i.e. when the system is overloaded.
</p>

<p>
I found that Object Orientation is in many cases detrimental to
performance, because people are so focused in API's and abstraction
that they forget about the hidden costs. For instance, it's common to
see a call-stack five levels deep (or more) just to do something as
simple as changing the value of a variable. Inheritance is
particularly evil due to its encapsulation breaking and
tight-coupling. When you think in terms of algorithms and data
structures, the costs are much more obvious.
</p>

<p>
In designing a modern OO system, it's best to: keep inheritance to an
absolute minimum, using either interfaces or client-supplier
relationships; keep behaviour to a minimum in the objects of your data
model - probably best if they are but glorified data structures with
getters/setters, on which other, more specialised classes operate on.
</p>

<p>
<b>Do not optimise early</b>. One classic case of early optimisation in C++
is not using virtual functions because of performance. This may be
true in certain cases, but you need to be coding really close to the
metal to start suffering from it. However, many programmers refuse to
consider inheritance or interfaces at design-time - even in systems
where microsecond performance will never be an issue - limiting their
options dramatically, for no real gain whatsoever. There are many,
many other such examples - like designing your own string class before
you proved it to be a bottleneck.
</p>

<p>
<b>Misuse of threads</b>. Another classic case in server side programming
is thread misuse. Many developers look at every bit of code and think:
"I'll stick a thread pool in there; this will scale really neatly when
we have more processors". The end result of this sort of thinking was
apparent at one customer site, where they had over 170 threads (!!!)
for one single server application. This application was running in
boxes with 64 processors, and sharing them with other instances as
well as other servers which also made liberal use of threads.
</p>

<p>
The problem with this approach is obvious: very rarely is there a need
to have more threads than processors (unless you're doing IO bound
work; and even then, threading may not be the best solution; consider
multiplexing); really thread-safe code requires lots of locking; when
you finally make your code multithread-safe you may find it performs
as badly as single threaded code - if not worse!  having ridiculous
amounts of threads hinders performance even if they are doing nothing
(as it was the case with our application above) because threads
consume resources and take time to construct and destroy.  Server side
and threading go hand-in-had, like bread and butter. But they should
only be used in cases where few or no locking is required - and that
requires large amounts of experience in application design.

<p>
Designing large-scale, server side systems is a very difficult job and
should not be taken lightly. Lack of experience normally leads to
using the wrong technologies and making wrong fundamental
architectural decisions, which cannot be fixed at a later date. When
designing a large system from scratch, one should always prefer the
proven approaches to the new ideas the market keeps on churning.
