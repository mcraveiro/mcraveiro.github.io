</p>

<p>
Over the last few years I've had a little project on the side called
<i><a href="https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen">Dogen</a></i>. Dogen is a code generator designed to target domain models,
with the lofty ambition of automating the modeling process as much as
possible: users create domain models using a supported UML tool and
respecting a set of predefined restrictions; Dogen uses the toolâ€™s
diagram files to generate the source code representation. The
generated code contains most of the services required from a typical
domain object such as serialisation, hashing, streaming and so on.
Dogen is written in C++ 14 and generates C++ 14 too, but other
languages will eventually be supported as well.
</p>

<p>
Now, for a four-year-old project, I guess it's fair to say that Dogen
hasn't exactly set the Open Source world on fire. Nevertheless, it has
proven to be a personal fountain of lessons and experiences on
software development; one such lesson was package management and
that's what I shall reminisce about in this article.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgdfb6e81" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgdfb6e81">The Conundrum</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdfb6e81">
<p>
Like any other part-time C++ developer whose professional mainstay is
C# and Java, I have keenly felt the need for a package manager when in
C++-land. The problem is less visible when you are working with mature
libraries and dealing with just Linux, due to the huge size of the
package repositories and the great tooling built around them. However,
things get messier when you start to go cross-platform, and messier
still when you are coding on the bleeding edge of C++: either the
package you need is not available in the distro's repos or even <a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bppas">PPA's</a>;
or, when it is, its rarely at the version you require.
</p>

<p>
Alas, for all our sins, that's exactly where we were when Dogen got
started.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1a7bf71" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1a7bf71">A Spoonful of Dogen History</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1a7bf71">
<p>
Dogen sprung to life just a tad after C++-0x became <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%252B%252B11">C++-11</a>, so we
experienced first hand the highs of a quasi-new-language followed by
the lows of feeling the brunt of the bleeding edge pain. For starters,
<i>nothing</i> we ever wanted was available out of the box, on any of the
platforms we were interested in. Even Debian Testing was a fair bit
behind the curve - probably stalled due to a compiler transition or
other. In those days, Real Programmers were Real Programmers and mice
were mice: we had to <a href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/nerd-food-c-11-with-gcc.html">build and install the C++ compilers ourselves</a>
and, even then, C++-11 support was new, a bit flaky and limited. We
then had to use those compilers to compile all of the dependencies in
C++-11 mode.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgdce423a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgdce423a">The PFH Days</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgdce423a">
<p>
After doing this manually once or twice, it soon stopped being
fun. And so we solved this problem by creating the PFH - the Private
Filesystem Hierarchy - a gloriously over-ambitious name to describe a
set of wrapper scripts that helped with the process of downloading
tarballs, unpacking, building and finally installing them into
well-defined locations. It worked well enough in the confines of its
remit, but we were often outside those, having to apply out-of-tree
patches, adding new dependencies and so on. We also didn't use Travis
then; not even sure it existed, but if it did, the rigmarole of the
bleeding edge experience would certainly put a stop to any ideas of
using it. So we used a local install of CDash with a number of build
agents on OSX, Windows (MinGW) and Linux (32-bit and 64-bit). Things
worked beautifully when nothing changed and the setup was stable; but
every time a new version of a library - or god forbid, of a compiler -
was released, one had that sense of dread: do I <b>really</b> need to
upgrade? And yet we often did, because we needed the features.
</p>

<p>
Since one of the main objectives of Dogen was to learn about C++-11,
one has to say that the pain was worth it. But all of the moving parts
described above were not ideal and they were certainly not the thing
you want to be wasting your precious time on when it is very
scarce. They were certainly not scalable.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge765e60" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge765e60">The Good Days and the Bad Days</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge765e60">
<p>
Things improved slightly for a year or two when distros started
shipping C++-11 compliant compilers and recent Boost versions. This
led to an attack of pragmatism, during which we ditched all platforms
except for Linux, got rid of almost all our private infrastructure and
moved over to <a href="https://travis-ci.org/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen">Travis</a>. For a while things looked really good. However,
due to Travis' <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS">Ubuntu LTS</a> policy, we were stuck with a rapidly ageing
Boost version. At first PPAs were a good solution, but over time these
became stale too.
</p>

<p>
Soon we were stuck, unable to afford to revert back to the bad old
days of the PFH but also unable to freeze all dependencies in time, as
it would provide a worse development experience. So it was that the
only route left was to break the build on Travis and hope that a
solution would manifest itself. The red build painfully lingered on,
commit after commit, whilst alternatives such as Drone.io and GitLab
were unsuccessfully tried.
</p>

<p>
Finally, there was nothing else for it. We simply needed a package
manager to manage the development dependencies.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgc6f6269" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc6f6269">Nuget Hopes Dashed</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc6f6269">
<p>
Having used <a href="https://www.nuget.org/">Nuget</a> in anger for both C# and C++ projects - and given
Microsoft's recent change of heart with regards to open source - I was
secretly hoping that Nuget would get some traction in the wider C++
world. Nuget works <a href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/nerd-food-using-mono-in-anger-part-ii_3422.html">well enough in Mono</a>, and C++ support for Windows
was added fairly <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2013/04/26/nuget-for-c.aspx">early on</a>. It was somewhat limited and a bit quirky at
the start but it kept on getting better, to the point of being
actually usable; we now use Nuget to manage our C++ dependencies at
work - a Windows shop on the main - and it has improved our quality of
life dramatically.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the troubles begun on closer inspection. The truth is
that Microsoft's current Nuget focus is C# and Visual Studio, not
Linux and C++. Also, it seems that outside Microsoft and Xamarin there
just isn't enough traction for this tool at present.
</p>

<p>
However, there have been a couple of recent announcements from
Microsoft that give me hope things may change in the future:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2015/12/04/introducing-clang-with-microsoft-codegen-in-vs-2015-update-1.aspx">Clang with Microsoft CodeGen in VS 2015 Update 1</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2015/12/15/support-for-android-cmake-projects-in-visual-studio.aspx">Support for Android CMake projects in Visual Studio</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Surely the logical consequence is to be able to manage packages in a
consistent way across platforms? We can but hope.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org4e1af12" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org4e1af12">Biicode Comes to the Rescue?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4e1af12">
<p>
Nuget did not pan out but what did happen was even more unlikely: some
crazy-cool Spaniards had decided to create a stand alone package
manager. Being from the same peninsula, I felt compelled to use their
wares, and was joyful as they went from strength to strength -
including the success of their <a href="https://www.biicode.com/biicode-open-source-challenge">open source campaign</a>. And I loved the
fact that it integrated really well with <a href="https://cmake.org">CMake</a>, and that <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/">CLion</a>
provided Biicode integration very early on.
</p>

<p>
However, my biggest problem with Biicode was that it was just too
complicated. I don't mean to say the creators of the product didn't
have very good reasons for their technical choices - lord knows
creating a product is hard enough, so I have nothing but praise to
anyone who tries. However, for me personally, I never had the time to
understand why Biicode needed its own version of CMake, nor did I want
to modify my CMake files too much in order to fit properly with
Biicode and so on. Basically, I needed a solution that worked well and
required minimal changes at my end. Having been brought up with Maven
and Nuget, I just could not understand why there wasn't a simple
<code>packages.xml</code> file that specified the dependencies and then some
non-intrusive CMake support to expose those into the CMake files. As
you can see from some of <a href="http://forum.biicode.com/t/building-out-of-tree-using-biicode/460">my posts</a>, it just seemed it required
"getting" Biicode in order to make use of it, which for me was not an
option.
</p>

<p>
Another thing that annoyed me was the difficulty on knowing what the
"real" version of a library was. I wrote, at the time:
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
One slightly confusing thing about the process of adding dependencies
is that there may be more than one page for a given dependency and it
is not clear which one is the "best" one. For RapidJson there are
three options, presumably from three different Biicode users:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.biicode.com/fenix/rapidjson">fenix</a>: authored on 2015-Apr-28, v1.0.1.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.biicode.com/hithwen/rapidjson">hithwen</a>: authored 2014-Jul-30</li>
<li><a href="https://www.biicode.com/denis/rapidjson">denis</a>: authored 2014-Oct-09</li>
</ul>

<p>
The "fenix" option appeared to be the most up-to-date so I went with
that one. However, this illustrates a deeper issue: how do you know
you can trust a package? In the ideal setup, the project owners would
add Biicode support and that would then be the one true
version. However, like any other project, Biicode faces the initial
adoption conundrum: people are not going to be willing to spend time
adding support for Biicode if there aren't a lot of users of Biicode
out there already, but without a large library of dependencies there
is nothing to draw users in. In this light, one can understand that it
makes sense for Biicode to allow anyone to add new packages as a way
to bootstrap their user base; but sooner or later they will face the
same issues as all distributions face.
</p>

<p>
A few features would be helpful in the mean time:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>popularity/number of downloads</li>
<li>user ratings</li>
</ul>

<p>
These metrics would help in deciding which package to depend on.
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
For all these reasons, I never found the time to get Biicode setup and
these stories lingered in Dogen's backlog. And the build continued to
be red.
</p>

<p>
Sadly Biicode the company <a href="http://blog.biicode.com/biicode-just-the-company-post-mortem/">didn't make it either</a>. I feel very sad for
the guys behind it, because their heart was on the right place.
</p>

<p>
Which brings us right up to date.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgf73f242" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf73f242">Enter Conan</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf73f242">
<p>
When I was a kid, we were all big fans of Conan. No, not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conan_the_Barbarian">the
barbarian</a>, the Japanese Manga <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Boy_Conan">Future Boy Conan</a>. For me the name Conan
will always bring back great memories of this show, which we watched
in the original Japanese with Portuguese subtitles. So I was secretly
pleased when I found <a href="https://www.conan.io/">conan.io</a>, a new package management system for
C++. The guy behind it seems to be one of the original Biicode
developers, so a lot of lessons from Biicode were learned.
</p>

<p>
To cut a short story short, the great news is I managed to add Conan
support to Dogen in roughly <a href="https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/sprint_backlog_77.org#add-support-for-conanio">3 hours</a> and with very minimal knowledge
about Conan. This to me was a litmus test of sorts, because I have
very little interest in package management - creating my own product
has proven to be challenging enough, so the last thing I need is to
divert my energy further. The other interesting thing is that roughly
half of that time was taken by trying to get Travis to behave, so its
not quite fair to impute it to Conan.
</p>

<h3 id="org5682773">Setting Up Dogen for Conan</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5682773">
<p>
So, what changes did I do to get it all working? It was a very simple
3-step process. First I installed Conan using a Debian package from
<a href="https://www.conan.io/downloads">their site</a>.
</p>

<p>
I then created a <code>conanfile.txt</code> on my top-level directory:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orge44b384">
[requires]
Boost/1.60.0@lasote/stable

[generators]
cmake
</pre>

<p>
Finally I modified my top-level <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org767381c">
# conan support
if(EXISTS "${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/conanbuildinfo.cmake")
    message(STATUS "Setting up Conan support.")
    include("${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/conanbuildinfo.cmake")
    CONAN_BASIC_SETUP()
else()
    message(STATUS "Conan build file not found, skipping include")
endif()

This means that it is entirely possible to build Dogen without Conan,
but if it is present, it will be used. With these two changes, all
that was left to do was to build:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org64a1b04">
$ cd dogen/build/output
$ mkdir gcc-5-conan
$ conan install ../../..
$ make -j5 run_all_specs
</pre>

<p>
<i>Et voila</i>, I had a brand spanking new build of Dogen using
Conan. Well, actually, <i>not quite</i>. I've omitted a couple of problems
that are a bit of a distraction on the Conan success story. Let's look
at them now.

<h3 id="org89b38c1">Problems and Their Solutions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org89b38c1">
<p>
The first problem was that Boost 1.59 does not appear to have an
overridden <code>FindBoost</code>, which means that I was not able to link. I
moved to Boost 1.60 - which I wanted to do anyway - and it worked out
of the box.
</p>

<p>
The second problem was that Conan seems to get confused with <a href="https://ninja-build.org/manual.html">Ninja</a>, my
build system of choice. For whatever reason, when I use the Ninja
generator, it fails like so:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org2e06ebe">
$ cmake ../../../ -G Ninja
$ ninja -j5
$ ninja: error: '~/.conan/data/Boost/1.60.0/lasote/stable/package/ebdc9c0c0164b54c29125127c75297f6607946c5/lib/libboost_system.so', needed by 'stage/bin/dogen_utility_spec', missing and no known rule to make it
</pre>

<p>
This is very strange because boost system is clearly available in the
Conan download folder. Going back to <code>make</code> solved this problem. I've
opened an issue in Conan (<a href="https://github.com/conan-io/conan/issues/56">#56</a>) and its currently under investigation.
</p>

<p>
The third problem is more boost related than anything else. Boost
Graph has not been as well maintained as it should, really. Thus users
now find themselves carrying patches, and all because no one seems to
be able to apply them upstream. Dogen is in this situation as we've
hit the issue described here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25395805/compile-error-with-boost-graph-1-56-0-and-g-4-6-4">Compile error with boost.graph 1.56.0
and g++ 4.6.4.</a> Sadly this is still present on Boost 1.60; the patch
exists in Trac but remains unapplied (<a href="https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/10382">#10382</a>). This is a tad worrying
as we make a lot of use of Boost Graph and intend to increase the
usage in the future.
</p>

<p>
At any rate, as you can see, none of the problems were showstoppers,
nor can they all be attributed to Conan.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge4e7ac6">
<p>
Once I got Dogen building locally, I then went on a mission to
convince Travis to use it. It was painful, but mainly because of the
lag between commits and hitting an error. The core of the changes to
my YML file were as follows:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org604db3b">
install:
&lt;snip&gt;
  # conan
  - wget https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conanio-production/downloads/conan-ubuntu-64_0_5_0.deb -O conan.deb
  - sudo dpkg -i conan.deb
  - rm conan.deb
&lt;snip&gt;
script:
  - export GIT_REPO="`pwd`"
  - cd ${GIT_REPO}/build
  - mkdir output
  - cd output
  - conan install ${GIT_REPO}
  - hash=`ls ~/.conan/data/Boost/1.60.0/lasote/stable/package/`
  - cd ~/.conan/data/Boost/1.60.0/lasote/stable/package/${hash}/include/
  - sudo patch -p0 &lt; ${GIT_REPO}/patches/boost_1_59_graph.patch
  - cmake ${GIT_REPO} -DWITH_MINIMAL_PACKAGING=on
  - make -j2 run_all_specs
&lt;snip&gt;
</pre>

<p>
I probably should have a bash script by know, given the size of the
YML, but hey - if it works. The changes above deal with installation
of the package, applying the boost patch and using Make instead of
Ninja. Quite trivial in the end, even though it required a lot of
iterations to get there.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org82bf114">
<p>
Having a red build is a very distressful event for a developer, so you
can imagine how painful it has been to have red builds for <i>several
months</i>. So it is with unmitigated pleasure that I got to see <a href="https://travis-ci.org/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/builds/98304957">build
#628</a> in a shiny emerald green. As far as that goes, it has been an
unmitigated success.
</p>

<p>
In a broader sense though, what can we say about Conan? There are many
positives to take home, even at this early stage of Dogen usage:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>it is a lot less intrusive than Biicode and easier to setup. Biicode
was very well documented, but it was easy to stray from the beaten
track and that then required reading a lot of different wiki
pages. It seems easier to stay on the beaten track with Conan.</li>
<li>as with Biicode, it seems to provide solutions to Debug/Release and
multi-platforms and compilers. We shall be testing it on Windows
soon and reporting back.</li>
<li>hopefully, since it started Open Source from the beginning, it will
form a community of developers around the source with the know-how
required to maintain it. It would also be great to see if a business
forms around it, since someone will have to pay the cloud bill. It
certainly is gaining popularity, as <a href="http://cppcast.com/2016/05/diego-rodriguez-losada/">the recent CppCast</a> attests.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In terms of negatives:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I still believe the most scalable approach would have been to extend
Nuget for the C++ Linux use case, since Microsoft is willing to take
patches and since they foot the bill for the public repo. However,
I can understand why one would prefer to have total control over the
solution rather than depend on the whims of some middle-manager in
order to commit.</li>
<li>it seems publishing packages requires getting down into
Python. Haven't tried it yet, but I'm hoping it will be made as easy
as importing packages with a simple text file. The more complexity
around these flows the tool adds, the less likely they are to be
used.</li>
<li>there still are no "official builds" from projects. As explained
above, this is a chicken and egg problem, because people are only
willing to dedicate time to it once there are enough users
complaining. Having said that, since Conan is easy to setup, one
hopes to see some adoption in the near future.</li>
<li>even when using a GitHub profile, one still has to define a Conan
specific password. This was not required with Biicode. Minor pain,
but still, if they want to increase traction, this is probably an
unnecessary stumbling block. It was sufficient to make me think
twice about setting up a login, for one.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In truth, these are all very minor negative points, but still worth
making them. All and all, I am quite pleased with Conan thus far.
