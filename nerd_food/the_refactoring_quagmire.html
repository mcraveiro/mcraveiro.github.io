<p>
<a href="https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/v1/sprint_backlog_07.org">The latest Dogen sprint</a> turned out to be a really long and tortuous
one, which is all the more perplexing given the <a href="https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/v1/sprint_backlog_06.org">long</a> <a href="https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/v1/sprint_backlog_05.org">list</a> of <a href="https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/v1/sprint_backlog_04.org">hard</a>
<a href="https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/v1/sprint_backlog_03.org">sprints</a> that preceded it. Clearly, the slope of the curve is
steepening unrelentingly. Experience teaches that whenever you find
yourself wandering over such terrains, it is time to stop and gather
your thoughts; more likely than not, you are going the wrong way -
fast.
</p>

<p>
Thus, for Dogen, this a post of reflection. To the casual reader - if
nothing else - it will hopefully serve as a cautionary tale.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orge43ca99" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge43ca99">Not Even Wrong</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge43ca99">
<p>
If you are one of the lucky few internauts who avidly follows our
release notes, you may recall that the <a href="https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/releases/tag/v1.0.06">previous sprint</a> had produced a
moment of enlightenment where we finally understood <code>yarn</code> as <i>the</i>
core of Dogen. At the time, it felt like one of those rare <i>eureka</i>
moments, and "the one last great change to the architecture";
afterwards, all would be light. "Famous last words", you may have said
then and, of course, if you did, you were right. But given the
historical context, the optimism wasn't entirely unjustified. To
understand why, we need to quickly recap how the architecture has
evolved over time.
</p>

<p>
Dogen started out divided into three very distinct parts: the
frontends (Dia, JSON), the middle-end (<code>yarn</code>) and the backends (C++,
C#). The "pipeline" metaphor guided our design because we saw Dogen
very much like a compiler, with its frontend, middle-end and backend
stages. This was very handy as it meant we could test all stages of
the pipeline in isolation. Composition was done by orchestrating
frontend, middle-end and backends, at a higher level. This
architecture had very good properties when it came to testability and
debuggability: we'd start by running the entire pipeline and locating
the problem; then, one could easily isolate the issue to a specific
component either by looking at the log file, or by dumping the inputs
and outputs of the different stages and sifting through them. As a
result, bug reproduction was very straightforward since we just needed
to record the inputs and create the test at the right level. Whilst
the names of the models and their responsibilities changed over time,
the overall pipeline architecture remained so since the very early
days of Dogen.
</p>

<p>
In parallel to this, a second trend had emerged over the last ten
sprints or so: we moved more and more functionality from the frontends
and backends to the middle-end. The key objective here was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%2527t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>: we
soon found a lot of commonalities between frontends, driving us to
create a simple frontend intermediate format so that the work was
carried out only once. Not long after, we discovered that backends
suffered from precisely the same malaise, so the same cure begun to be
applied there too. So far so good, as we were following <a href="http://www.dmi.usherb.ca/~sgiroux/COURS/2008/ift785/fichiers/articles/Roberts_EvolvingFrameworks.pdf">Roberts and
Johnson's</a> sage advice:
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
People develop abstractions by generalizing from concrete
examples. Every attempt to determine the correct abstractions on paper
without actually developing a running system is doomed to failure. No
one is that smart. A framework is a reusable design, so you develop it
by looking at the things it is supposed to be a design of. The more
examples you look at, the more general your framework will be.
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
The literature was with us and the wind was on our sails: the concrete
code in the frontends and backends was slowly cleaned up, made general
and moved across to the middle-end. As this process took hold, the
middle-end grew and grew in size and responsibilities, just as
everybody else shed them. Before long, we ended up with one big model,
a couple medium-sized models and lots of very small models:
"modelets", we named them. These were models with very little
responsibility other than gluing together one or two things. The
overhead of maintaining a physical component (e.g. static or dynamic
library) for the sake of one or two classes seemed a tad too
high.
</p>

<p>
As we begun to extrapolate the trend somewhat, a vision suddenly
appeared: why not centralise <b>everything</b> in the middle-end? That is:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>place <b>all</b> meta-models and transforms in one single central
location, together with their orchestration; call it the "core
model";</li>
<li>orchestration becomes either helper code or a transform in its own
right;</li>
<li>within this "core model", provide interfaces that backends and
frontends implement, injecting them dynamically;</li>
<li>make these new interfaces appear as transform chains themselves
(mostly).</li>
</ul>

<p>
In this elegant and clean brave new world, we would no longer have
"ends" as such but something more akin to "plugins", dynamically glued
into the "middle-end" via the magic of dependency injection; the
"middle-end" itself would no longer be a "middle" but <i>the</i> center of
everything. Backends and frontends had to merely implement the
interfaces supplied by the core and the system would just magically
sort itself out. The idea seemed amazing and we quickly moved to
implementation.
</p>

<p>
Alas, in our haste to jump into the fray, we had forgotten to heed
Mencken:
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
[T]here is always a well-known solution to every human problem — neat,
plausible, and wrong.
</p>

<h2 id="org85a548a">The Strange Loop</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org85a548a">
<p>
One of the biggest downsides of working alone and in your spare time
is the lack of feedback from other developers. And it's not even just
that other developers will teach you lots of new things. No, most
often than not, they'll simply drag you away from the echo chambers
and tunnels of self-reinforcement you carefully craft and curate for
yourself. You are your own intellectual jailer.
</p>

<p>
In the cold light of day, any developer will tell you that creating
cycles is not a good idea, and should not be done without a great deal
of thought. Yet, we managed to create "circular" dependencies between
all components of the system by centralising all responsibilities into
<code>yarn</code>. Now, you may say that these are not "canonically circular" -
and this is probably why the problem was not picked up in the first
place - because <code>yarn</code> provides interfaces for other models to
implement. Well, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Large-Scale-C-Software-Design-APC/dp/0201633620">Lakos</a> is very helpful here in explaining what is
going on: our <i>logical design</i> had no cycles - because <code>yarn</code> does not
explicitly call any frontends or backends - but the <i>physical design</i>
did have them. And these came at a cost.
</p>

<p>
For starters, it screwed up <a href="https://the-whiteboard.github.io/coding/debugging/2016/04/07/reasonable-code.html">reasonability</a>. Even though frontends and
backends still had their own models, the net result was that we
jumbled up all of the elements of the pipeline into a single model,
making it really hard to tell what's what. Explaining the system to a
new developer now required saying things such as "ah, don't worry
about that part for now, it belongs to the middle-end, but here we are
dealing only with the backends" - a clear code smell. Once a property
of the architecture, reasonability now had to be conveyed in lossy
natural language. Testability and debuggability got screwed up too
because now everything went through one single central model; if you
needed to test a frontend fix you still required building the backends
and middle-end and initialise them too. Our pursuit of clarity muddied
up the waters.
</p>

<p>
To make matters worse, an even more pertinent question arose: just
when exactly should you stop refactoring? In my two decades of
professional development, I had never encountered this problem. In the
real world, you are fortunate if you get a tiny amount of time
allocated to refactoring - most of the time you need to somehow sneak
it in into some overall estimate and hope no one notices. Like sharks,
Project Managers (PM) are bred to smell refactoring efforts from a
mile a way and know how to trim estimates down to the bone. Even when
you are in a greenfield project or just lucky enough to have an
enlightened PM who will bat for you, you still need to contend with
the realities of corporate development: you need to ship, <i>now</i>. No
one gets away with endless refactoring. No one, that is, other than
the Free and Open Source Software Developer.
</p>

<p>
Like many a spare time project, Dogen is my test bed of ideas around
coding and coding processes; a general sandbox to have fun outside of
work. As such - and very much by design - the traditional feedback
loops that exist in the real world need not apply. I wanted to see
what would happen if you coded without <i>any</i> constraints and, in the
end, what I found out was that if you do not self-impose some kind of
halting machinery, <i>you will refactor on forever</i>. In practice,
physics still apply, so your project will eventually die out because
its energy will dissipate across the many refactoring fronts and
entropy will, as always, triumph. But if you really want to keep it at
bay, at least for a little while, you need to preserve energy by
having one single, consistent vision - "wrong" as it may be according
to some metric or other. For, as Voltaire said and we often forget,
"le mieux est l'ennemi du bien".
</p>

<p>
The trouble is that refactoring is made up of a set of engineering
trade-offs, and when you optimise for one thing you'll inevitably make
something else worse. So, first and foremost, you need to make sure
you understand what your trade-offs are, and prioritise
accordingly. Secondly, looking for a global minima in such a gigantic
multidimensional space is impossible, so you need to make do with
local minima. But how do you known you reach a "good enough" point in
that space? You need some kind of conceptual cost function.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgceb127f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgceb127f">Descending the Gradient</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgceb127f">
<p>
So it was that we started by defining the key dimensions across which
we were trying to optimise. This can be phrased slightly differently:
given what we now know about the domain and its implementation, what
are the most important characteristics of an idealised physical and
logical design?
</p>

<p>
After some thinking, the final answer was deceptively simple:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the entities of the logical design (models, namespaces, classes,
methods and the like) should reflect what one reads in the
literature of Model Driven Engineering (MDE). That is, a person
competent on the field should find a code base that talks his or
her language.</li>
<li>logical and physical design should promote reasonability and
isolation, and thus orchestration should be performed via
composition rather than by circular physical dependencies.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For now, these are the two fundamental pillars guiding the Dogen
architecture; any engineering trade-offs to be made must ensure these
dimensions take precedence. In other words, we can only optimise away
any "modelets" if they do not impact negatively either of these two
dimensions. If they do, then we must discard this refactoring
option. More generally, it is now possible to "cost" all refactoring
activity - a conceptual refactoring gradient descent if you'd like; it
either brings us closer to the local minima or further away. It gave
us a sieve with which to filter the product and sprint backlogs.
</p>

<p>
To cut a rather long story short, we ended up with a "final" - ha,
ha - set of changes to the architecture to get us closer to the local
minima:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>move away from sewing terms</b>: from the beginning we had used terms
such as <code>knitter</code>, <code>yarn</code> and so forth. These were&#x2026; colourful, but
did not add any value and detracted us from the first
dimension. This was a painful decision but clearly required if one
is to comply to point one above: we need to replace all sewing terms
with domain specific vocabulary.</li>
<li><b>reorganise the models into a pipeline</b>: however, instead of simply
going back to the "modelets" of the past, we need to have a deep
think as to what responsibilities belong at what stage of the
pipeline. Perhaps the "modelets" were warning us of design failures.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2 id="org626295a">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org626295a">
<p>
Its never a great feeling when you end a long and arduous sprint only
to figure out you were going in the wrong direction in design
space. In fact, it is rather frustrating. We have many stories in the
product backlog which are really exciting and which will add real
value to the end users - well, at this point, just us really but hey -
yet we seemed to be lost in some kind of refactoring ground hog day,
with no end in sight. However, the main point of Dogen is to teach,
and learn we undoubtedly did.
</p>

<p>
As with anything in the physical world, nothing in software
engineering exists in splendid perfection like some kind of platonic
solid. Perfection belongs to the realm of maths. In engineering,
something can only be described as "fit for purpose", and to do so
requires to first determine best we can what that purpose might
be. So, before you wonder into a refactoring quagmire of your own
making, be sure to have a very firm idea of what your trade-offs are.
