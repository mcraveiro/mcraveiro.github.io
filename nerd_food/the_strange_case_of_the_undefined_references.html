Thursday, June 16, 2016
</p>

<p>
As a kid, I loved reading Sherlock Holmes and Poirot novels. Each book
got me completely spellbound, totally immersed and pretty much unable
to do anything else until I finally found out whodunnit. Somehow, the
culprits were never the characters I suspected of. Debugging and
troubleshooting difficult software engineering problems is a lot like
the plot of a crime novel: in both cases you are trying to form a
mental picture of something that happened, with very incomplete
information - the clues; in both cases, experience and attention to
detail is crucial, with many a wrong path taken before the final
eureka moment; and, in both cases too, there is this overwhelming
sense of urgency in figuring out whodunnit. Of course, unlike a crime
novel, we'd all prefer not having to deal with these kinds of
"interesting" issues, but you don't choose the problems - they choose
you.
</p>

<p>
I recently had to deal with one such problem, which annoyed me to no
end until I finally fixed it. It was so annoying I decided it was
worth blogging about - if nothing else, it may save other people from
the same level of pain and misery.
</p>

<p>
A bit of context for those that are new here. Dogen is a pet project
that I've been maintaining for a few years now. Like many other C++
projects, it relies on the foundational Boost libraries. To be fair,
we rely on other stuff as well - libraries such as LibXML2 and so on -
but Boost is our core C++ dependency and the only one where latest is
greatest, so it tends to cause us the most problems. I've covered my
past woes in terms of dependency management and how happy I was to
find Conan. And so it was that life was bliss for a number of builds,
until one day…
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgfeb02d3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgfeb02d3">It All Started With a Warning</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfeb02d3">
<p>
It was a rainy day and I must have been bored because I noticed a
rather innocuous-looking warning on my Travis build, related to Conan:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code>CMake Warning (dev) in build/output/conanbuildinfo.cmake:
  Syntax Warning in cmake code at
    /home/travis/build/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/build/output/conanbuildinfo.cmake:142:88
  Argument not separated from preceding token by whitespace.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:30 (include)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
</code></pre>

<p>
Little did I know that this simple discovery would lead to a sequence
of troublesome events and to many a broken build. I decided to report
the problem to the Conan developers who, with their usual promptness,
rolled up their sleeves, quickly bounced ideas back and forth and then
did a sterling job in spinning fixes until we got to the bottom of the
issue. Some of the fixes were to Conan itself, whereas some others
were related to rebuilding Boost. In the heat of the investigation, I
bumped into some very troubling - and apparently unrelated - linking
errors:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code>/home/travis/.conan/data/Boost/1.60.0/lasote/stable/package/ebdc9c0c0164b54c29125127c75297f6607946c5/lib/libboost_log.so: undefined reference to `std::invalid_argument::invalid_argument(std::__cxx11::basic_string&lt;char, std::char_traits&lt;char&gt;, std::allocator&lt;char&gt; &gt; const&amp;)@GLIBCXX_3.4.21'
/home/travis/.conan/data/Boost/1.60.0/lasote/stable/package/ebdc9c0c0164b54c29125127c75297f6607946c5/lib/libboost_log.so: undefined reference to `std::__cxx11::basic_string&lt;char, std::char_traits&lt;char&gt;, std::allocator&lt;char&gt; &gt;::find(char const*, unsigned long, unsigned long) const@GLIBCXX_3.4.21'
</code></pre>

<p>
The build was littered with errors such as these. But the most
puzzling thing was that I had changed nothing of consequence on my
side and the Conan guys changed very little at their end too! What on
earth was going on?
</p>

<p>
After quite a lot of thinking, Conan's <a href="https://github.com/memsharded">memsharded</a> came up a startling
conclusion: we've been hit by one of those rare-but-dreadful
ABI-transitions! His comment is worth <a href="https://github.com/conan-io/conan/issues/138#issuecomment-185163060">reading in full</a>, but the crux of
his findings is as follows (copied verbatim):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Boost packages, generated with travis use docker to manage different
versions of gcc, as gcc 5.2 or gcc 5.3</li>
<li>Those docker images are using modern linux distros, e.g. &gt; Ubuntu
15.10</li>
<li>By default, new modern linux distros have switched to the gcc &gt; 5.1
new C++11 ABI, that is libstdc++ is built with gcc &gt; 5.1, usually
named libcxx11, as well as the rest of the system. The libcxx11 ABI
is incompatible with the old gcc &lt; 5.1 libcxx98 ABI.</li>
<li>Building in such environment links with the new libcxx11 by default.</li>
<li>Now, we move to our user, package consumer environment, which could
be an Ubuntu 14.04, or a travis VM (12.04). Those distros use a
libcxx98 libstdc++, as a lot of programs of those distros depends on
the old libcxx98 ABI. It is not simple to replace it for the new
one, requiring to rebuild or reinstall large part of the system and
applications. Maybe it could be installed for dev only, and
specified in the build, but I have not been able yet.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Reading the above may have given you that sad, sinking feeling: "what
on earth is he on about, I just want to compile my code!", "Why oh why
is C++ so damn complicated!" and so forth. So, for the benefit of
those not in the know, let me try to provide the required background
to fully grok memsharded's comment.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf470dbb" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf470dbb">What's this ABI Malarkey Again?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf470dbb">
<p>
This topic may sound oddly familiar to the faithful reader of Nerd
Food and with good reason: we did cover ABIs in the distant past, at a
slightly lower level. The post in question was On MinGW, Cygwin and
Wine and it does provide some useful context to this discussion, but,
if you want a TL;DR, it basically dealt with kernel space and user
space and with things such as the C library. This time round we will
turn our attention to the C++ Standard Library.
</p>

<p>
In addition to specifying the C++ language, the C++ Standard also
defines the API of the C++ Standard Library - the classes and their
methods, the functions and so on. The C++ Standard Library is
responsible for providing a set of services for applications compiled
with a C++ compiler. So far, so similar to the C Standard
Library. Where things begin to differ is in the crucial matter of the
ABI. But first, lets get a working definition for ABI, just so we are
all on the same page. For this, we can do worse than using Linux
System Programming:
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
Whereas an API defines a source interface, an ABI defines the
low-level binary interface between two or more pieces of software on a
particular architecture. It defines how an application interacts with
itself, how an application interacts with the kernel, and how an
application interacts with libraries. An ABI ensures binary
compatibility, guaranteeing that a piece of object code will function
on any system with the same ABI, without requiring recompilation.
</p>

<p>
ABIs are concerned with issues such as calling conventions, byte
ordering, register use, system call invocation, linking, library
behavior, and the binary object format. The calling convention, for
example, defines how functions are invoked, how arguments are passed
to functions, which registers are preserved and which are mangled, and
how the caller retrieves the return value.
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
The second paragraph is especially crucial. You see, although both the
C and the C++ Standards are somewhat silent on the matter of
specifying an ABI, C tends to have a de facto standard for a given OS
on a given architecture. This may not sound like much and you may be
saying: "what, wait: the same OS on a different architecture has a
different ABI?" Yep, that is indeed the case. If you think about it,
it makes perfect sense; after all, C was carefully designed to be
equivalent to "portable assembler"; in order to achieve maximum
performance, one must not create artificial layers of indirection on
top of the hardware but instead expose it as is. So, by the same
token, two different C compilers working on the same architecture and
OS will tend to agree on the ABI. The reason why is because the OS
will also follow the hardware where it must, for performance reasons;
and where the OS can make choices, it more or less makes the choice
for everybody else. For example, until recently, if you were on
Windows, it did you no good to compile code into an ELF binary because
the law of the land was PE. Things have now changed dramatically, but
the general point remains: the OS and the hardware rule.
</p>

<p>
C++ inherits much of C's approach to efficiency, so at first blush you
may be fooled into thinking it too would have a de facto ABI standard
("for a given OS, " etc. etc.). However, there are a few crucial
differences that have grave consequences. Let me point out a few:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>C++'s support for genericity - such as function overloading,
templates, etc - is implemented by using name mangling; however,
each compiler tends to have their own mangling scheme.</li>
<li>implementation details such as the memory layout of objects in the
C++ Standard Library - in particular, as we shall see, std::string -
are important.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In the past, compiler vendors tended exacerbate differences such as
these; as it was with the UNIX wars, so too during the "C++ wars" did
it make sense to be as incompatible as possible in the never ending
hunt for monetisation. Thus, ABI specifications were kept internal and
were closely guarded secrets. But since then the world has changed. To
a large extent, C++ lost the huge amounts of funding it once had
during the nineties and part of the naughties, and many vendors either
went under or greatly reduced their efforts in this space. Two
compilers emerged as victors: MSVC on the Windows platform and - once
the dust of the EGCS fork finally settled - GCC everywhere else. The
excellent quality of GCC across a vast array of platforms and its
strict standards adherence - coupled with a quick response to the
standardisation efforts - resulted in total domination outside of
Windows. So much so that only recently did it meet a true challenger
in Clang. The brave new world in which we now find ourselves in is one
where C++ ABI standardisation is a real possibility - see Defining a
Portable C++ ABI.
</p>

<p>
But pray forgive the old hand, I digress again. The main point is
that, for a given OS on a given architecture, you normally had to
compile all your code with a single compiler; if you did that, you
were good to go. Granted, GCC never made any official promises to keep
its releases ABI-compatible, but in practice we came to rely on the
fact that new and old releases interoperated just fine since the days
of 3.x. And so did Clang, respecting GCC's ABI so carefully it made us
think of them as one happy family. Then, C++-11 arrived.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2b3c327" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2b3c327">Mixing and Matching</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2b3c327">
<p>
As described in <a href="http://developers.redhat.com/blog/2015/02/05/gcc5-and-the-c11-abi/">GCC5 and the C++11 ABI</a>, this pleasant state of affairs
was too idyllic to last forever:
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
[&#x2026;] [S]ome new complexity requirements in the C++11 standard require
ABI changes to several standard library classes to satisfy, most
notably to std::basic<sub>string</sub> and std::list. And since
std::basic<sub>string</sub> is used widely, much of the standard library is
affected.
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
On hindsight, the improvements in the std::string implementation are
great; as a grasshopper, I recall spending hours on end debugging my
code in the long forgotten days of EGGS 2.91, only to find out there
was a weird bug in the COW implementation for my architecture. That
was the first time - and as it happens, the last time too - I found a
library bug, and it made a strong impression on me, at that young
age. These people were not infallible.
</p>

<p>
These days I sit much higher up in the C++ stack. Like many, I didn't
read that carefully the GCC 5 release notes when it came out, relying
as usual on my distro to do the right thing. And, as usual, the
distros largely did, even though, unbeknown to many, a stir was
happening in their world<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
For example, see The Case of GCC-5.1 and the Two C++ ABIs to
understand Arch's pains.
</span>. But hey, who reads distro blogs, right?
Hidden comfortably under my Debian Testing lean-to, I was blissfully
unaware of this transition since my code continued to compile just
fine. Also, where things start to get hairy is when you need to mix
and match compiler versions and build settings - and who on their
right mind does that, right?
</p>

<p>
As it happens, this is a situation in which modern C++ users of Travis
may easily find themselves in, stuck as they are on either on Ubuntu
12.04 (2012) or Ubuntu 14.04 (2014). Nick Sarten's <a href="http://genbattle.bitbucket.org/blog/2016/01/17/c++-travis-ci/">blog post</a> rams the
point home in inimitable fashion:
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
Hold on, did I say GCC 4.6? Clang 3.4? WHAT YEAR IS IT?
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
Yes, what year is it indeed. So it is that most of us rely on PPA's to
bring the C++ environment on Travis up to date, such as the Ubuntu
Toolchain:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code>sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
</code></pre>

<p>
This always seemed like an innocent thing to do but after my linking
errors and memsharded discoveries, one suddenly started to question
everything: what settings did the PPA use to build? What settings were
used to build the Boost Conan packages? With what compiler? In what
distro? The nightmare was endless. It was clear this was going to lead
to tears before bedtime.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org379fc87" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org379fc87">The Long Road to a Solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org379fc87">
<p>
Whilst memsharded honed into the problem pretty quickly - less than a
couple of weeks - a complete solution to my woes was a lot more
elusive. In truth, this is the kind of situation where you need long
spells of concentrated effort, so working in your copious spare time
does not help at all. I first tried the easiest approach: to pray that
it would all go away by itself, given enough time. And, lo and behold,
things did work again, for a little while! And then started to fail
again; the Boost package in Conan got rebuilt and the build broke. And
that way it stayed.
</p>

<p>
Once waiting was no longer an option, I had to take it seriously and
started investigating in earnest. Trouble is, when you lose trust in
the compilation settings you then need to methodically validate
absolutely everything, until you bottom out the problem. And that
takes time. Many things were tried, including:

Predictably, the final step is the one I should have tried first, but
one is always lazy. Still, all of this got me wondering why had things
been so complicated. Normally one would be able to ldd or nm -C the
binary and figure out the dependencies, but in this case I seemed to
always be pointing to libstdc++.so.6 regardless. Most puzzling. And
then I found the Debian wiki page on <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/GCC5">GCC5</a>, which states:
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
The good news is, that GCC 5 now provides a stable libcxx11 ABI, and
stable support for C++11 (GCC version before 5 called this supported
experimental). This required some changes in the libstdc++ ABI, and
now libstdc++6 provides a dual ABI, the classic libcxx98 ABI, and the
new libcxx11 (GCC 5 (&lt;&lt; 5.1.1-20) only provides the classic libcxx98
ABI). The bad news is that the (experimental) C++11 support in the
classic libcxx98 ABI and the new stable libcxx11 ABIs are not
compatible, and upstream doesn't provide an upgrade path except for
rebuilding. Note that even in the past there were incompatibilities
between g++ versions, but not as fundamental ones as found in the
g++-5 update to stable C++11 support.
</p>

<p>
Using different libstdc++ ABIs in the same object or in the same
library is allowed, as long as you don't try to pass std::list to
something expecting std::_<sub>cxx11</sub>::list or vice versa. We should
rebuild everything with g++-5 (once it is the default). Using g++-4.9
as a fallback won't be possible in many cases.
</p>

<p>
libstdc++ (&gt;= 5.1.1-20) doesn't change the soname, provides a dual
ABI. Existing C++98 binary packages will continue to work. Building
these packages using g++-5 is expected to work after build failures
are fixed.
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
The crux is, of course, all the stuff about a dual ABI. I had never
bumped into the dual ABI beast before, and now that I did I'm not sure
I am entirely pleased. It's probably great when it just works, but
it's tricky to troubleshoot when it doesn't: are you linking against a
libstdc++ with dual ABI disabled/unsupported? Or is it some other
error you've introduced? Personally, having a completely different SO
name like memsharded had suggested seems like a less surprising
approach - e.g. call it libcxx11 instead of libstdc++. But, as always,
one has to play with the cards that were dealt so there is no point in
complaining.

The Ubuntu 14.04 build of Boost did get us a green build again, but
for all the joyous celebrations, there is still a grey cloud hovering
above since the mop-up exercise is not completed. I now need to figure
out how to build Boost with Conan on 14.04 and upload this version
into the package manager's repo. However, for now carpe diem. After so
much unproductive time, there is a real need for a few weeks (months!)
of proper coding - the reason why I have a spare time project in the
first place. But some lessons were learned.
</p>

<p>
Firstly, one cannot but feel truly annoyed at ${COSMIC<sub>DEITY</sub>} for
having to deal with issues such as this. After all, one of the reasons
I prefer C++ to the languages I use at work (C# and Java) is that it
is usually very transparent; normally I can very quickly reproduce,
diagnose and fix a problem in my code. Of course, lord knows this
statement is not true of all C++ code, but at least it tends to be
valid for most Modern C++ - and over the last five years that's all
the C++ I dealt with in anger. It was indeed rather irritating to find
out that the pain has not yet been removed from the language, and on
occasion, even experienced developers get bitten. Hard.
</p>

<p>
A second point worth of note is that in C++ - more so than in any
other language - one cannot just blindly trust the package
manager. There are just so many configuration knobs and buttons for
that to be possible, and one can easily get bitten by assumptions. The
sad truth is that even when using Conan, one should probably upload
one's own packages built with a well understood configuration. True,
this may cost time - but on the other hand, it will avoid wild goose
chases such as this one.
</p>

<p>
Finally, its also important to note that this whole episode
illustrates the sterling job that package maintainers do in
distributions. Paradoxically, their work is often so good that we tend
to be blissfully unaware of its importance. Articles such as
Maintainers Matter take a heightened sense of urgency after an
experience like this.
</p>

<p>
The road was narrow, long and troublesome. But, as with all Poirot
novels, there is always that satisfying feeling of finally finding out
whodunnit in the end.

There is one final twist to this story, which adds insult to injury
and further illustrates ${COSMIC<sub>DEITY</sub>}'s sense of humour. When I
finally attempted to restore our clang builds, I found out that LLVM
has disabled their APT repo for an unspecified length of time:
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
&gt; TL;DR: APT repo switched off due to excessive load / traffic
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
There are no alternatives at present to build with a recent
clang. Sometimes one has the feeling that the universe does not want
to play ball. Stiff upper lip and all that; mustn't grumble.
