</p>

<p>
As any computer geek would tell you, computer science is great in and
of itself and many of us could live long and contented lives inside
that box. But things certainly tend to become interesting when there
is a whole problem domain to model, and doubly so when that domain is
outside of our comfort zone. As it happens, I have managed to step
outside said zone - rather, quite far outside - so it seemed like a
good idea to chronicle these adventures here.
</p>

<p>
The journey we are about to embark starts with a deceptively simple
mission: to understand how one can use computers to model neurons. The
intended audience of these posts is anyone who loves coding but has no
idea about electricity, circuits, cells and so on - basically someone
very much like me. We shall try to explain, at least to a degree, all
of the required core concepts in order to start coding. As it turns
out, there are quite a few.
</p>

<p>
But hey, as <a href="http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/8742/did-einstein-say-if-you-cant-explain-it-simply-you-dont-understand-it-well-en">they say</a>, "If you can't explain something to a six
year-old, you really don't understand it yourself". So lets see if I
got it or not.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org18ac819" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org18ac819">I'm a Cell, Get Me Out Of Here!</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org18ac819">
<p>
A neuron is a cell, so it makes sense to start with cells. Cells are a
basic building block in biology and can be considered as the smallest
unit of a living organism - at least for our purposes, if nothing
else. The key idea behind a cell is as obvious as you'd like: there is
the inside, the outside, and the thing that separates both.
</p>

<p>
Of course, this being biology, we need to give it complicated
names. Accordingly, the inside of the cell is the cytoplasm and the
thing that separates the cell from the outside world is the
membrane. You can think of it as a tiny roundy-box-like thing, with
some gooey stuff inside. The material of the box is the membrane. The
gooey stuff is the cytoplasm. When we start describing the different
cellular structures - as we are doing here - we are talking about the
cell's morphology.
</p>

<p>
Living beings are made up of many, many cells - according to some
estimates, a human body would have several trillion - and cells
themselves come in many, many kinds. Fortunately, we are interested in
just one kind: the neuron.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org379aedd" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org379aedd">The Neuron Cell</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org379aedd">
<p>
The neuron is a nerve cell. Of course, there are many, many kinds of
neurons - nature just seems to love complexity - but they all share
things in common, and those things define their neuron-ness.
</p>

<p>
Unlike the "typical" cell we described above (i.e. "roundy-box-like
thing"), the neuron is more like a roundy-box-like thing with some
branches coming out of it. The box-like thing is the cell body and is
called soma. There are two types of branches: axons and dendrites. A
dendrite tends to be short, and it branches like a tree with a very
small trunk. The axon tends to be long and it also branches off like a
tree, but with a very long trunk. As we said, there are many kinds of
neurons, but a fair generalisation is that they tend to have few axons
(one or maybe a couple) and many dendrites (in the thousands).
</p>

<p><img src="./neuron_cell.png" alt="neuron_cell.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>Model of a neuron cell. Source: What is a Neuron?</p>
</div>

<p>
This very basic morphology is already sufficient to allows to start to
think of a neuron as a "computing device" - a strange kind of device
where the dendrites provide inputs and the axon outputs. The neuron
receives all these inputs, performs some kind of computation over
them, and produces an output.
</p>

<p>
The next logical question for a computer scientist is, then: "where do
the outputs come from and where do they go?". Imagining an idealised
neuron, the dendrites would be "connecting" to other dendrites or to
axons. At this juncture (pun not intended), we need to expand on what
exactly these "connections" are. In truth, its not that the axon binds
directly to the dendrite; there is always a gap between them. But this
gap is a special kind of gap, first because it is a very small gap and
second because it is one over which things can travel, from the axon
into the dendrite. This kind of connectivity between neurons is called
a synapse.
</p>

<p>
From this it is an easy leap to imagine that these sets of neurons
connected to other neurons begin to form "networks" of connectivity,
and these networks will also have computational-device-like
properties, just like a neuron. These are called neural networks. Our
brain happens to be one of these "neural networks", and a pretty large
one at that: it can have as many as <a href="http://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/brain-metrics/are_there_really_as_many">80-100 billion neurons</a>, connected
over some 1 quadrillion synapses. In these days of financial billions
and trillions, it is easy to be fooled into thinking 100 billion is
not a very large number, so to get a sense of perspective lets compare
it to another large network. The biggest and fastest growing
human-made network is the Internet, estimated to have some <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2905717">5 billion
connected devices</a> but less than <a href="http://bgp.potaroo.net/">600k connections in its core</a> - and yet
we are already <a href="http://research.dyn.com/2014/08/internet-512k-global-routes/">creacking at the seams</a>.

<h2 id="orgbc1ee16">The Need To Go Lower</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbc1ee16">
<p>
Alas, we must dig deeper before we start to understand how these
things behave in groups. Our skimpy first pass at the neuron
morphology left a lot of details out, which are required to understand
how they behave. As we explained, neurons have axons and dendrites,
and these are responsible for hooking them together. However, what is
interesting is what they talk about once they are hooked.
</p>

<p>
A neuron is can be thought of as an electrical device, and much of its
power (sorry!) stems from this. In general, as computer scientists, we
don't like to get too close to the physical messiness of the world of
hardware; we deem it sufficient to understand some high-level
properties, but rarely do we want to concern ourselves with
transistors or even - regrettably - registers or pipelines in the
CPU. With neurons, we can't get away with it. We need to understand
the hardware - or better, the wetware - and for that we have to go
very low-level.
</p>

<p>
We started off by saying cells have a membrane that separates the
outside world from the cytoplasm. That was a tad of an
oversimplification; after all, if the membrane did not allow anything
in, how would the cell continue to exist - or even come about in the
first place? In practice these membranes are permeable - or to be
precise, semi-permeable. This just means that it allows some stuff in
and some stuff out, under controlled circumstances. This is how a cell
gets energy in to do its thing and how it expels its unwanted content
out. Once things started to move in and out selectively, something
very interesting can start to happen: the build up of "electric
potential". However, rather unfortunately, in order to understand what
we mean by this, we need to cover the fundamentals of electricity.
</p>

<p>
Onward and downwards we march. Stay tuned for Part II.
