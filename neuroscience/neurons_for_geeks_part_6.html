<h1 class="title">Neurons for Computer Geeks - Part VI: LIF At Long Last!</h1>
<p>
<a href="index.html">Back to chapter index.</a>

</p>

<p>
Welcome to part VI of a multi-part series on modeling neurons. In <a href="neurons_for_geeks_part_5.html">part
V</a> we added a tad more theory to link electricity with neurons, and
also tried to give an idea of just how complex neurons are. Looking
back on that post, I cannot help but notice I skipped one bit that is
rather important to understanding Integrate-and-Fire (IAF) models. So
lets look at that first and then return to our trail.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org9ce24d5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org9ce24d5">Resting Potential and Action Potential</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9ce24d5">
<p>
We have spoken <a href="neurons_for_geeks_part_5.html">before</a> about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential">membrane potential</a> and the resting
membrane potential, but we did so with such a high degree of
hand-waving it now warrants revisiting. When we are talking about the
resting membrane potential we mean just that - the value for the
membrane potential when nothing much is happening. That is the magical
circa -65mv we discussed before - with all of the related explanations
on conventions around negative voltages. However, time does not stand
still and things happen. The cell receives input from other neurons,
and this varies over time. Some kinds of inputs can cause events to
trigger on the receiving neuron: active ion channels may get opened or
shut, ions move around, concentrations change and so forth, and thus,
the cell will change its membrane potential in response. When these
changes result in a higher voltage - such as moving to -60mv - we say
a depolarisation is taking place. Conversely, when the voltage becomes
more negative, we say hyperpolarisation is occurring.
</p>

<p>
Now, it may just happen that there is a short-lived but "strong" burst
of depolarisation, followed by equally rapid hyperpolarisation - and,
as a result of which, the Axon's terminal decides to release
neurotransmitters into the synapse (well, into the synaptic gap or
synaptic cleft to be precise). This is called an action potential, and
it is also known by many other names such as "nerve impulses" or
"spikes". When you hear that "a neuron has fired" this means that an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential">action potential</a> has just been emitted. If you record the neuron's
behaviour over time you will see a spike train - a plot of the voltage
over time, clearly showing the spikes. Taking a fairly random example:
</p>


<div id="org87c2992" class="figure">
<p><img src="./Simulation_of_hrose_neuron.png" alt="Simulation_of_hrose_neuron.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>Source: Wikipedia, Neural oscillation</p>
</div>

<p>
One way of picturing this is as a kind of "chain-reaction" whereby
something triggers the voltage of the neuron to rise, which triggers a
number of gates to open, which then trigger the voltage to rise and so
on, until some kind of magic voltage threshold is reached where the
inverse occurs: the gates that were causing the voltage to rise shut
and some other gates that cause the voltage to decrease open, and so
on, until we fall back down to the resting membrane potential. The
process feeds back on itself, first as a positive feedback and then as
a negative feedback. In the case of the picture above, something else
triggers us again and again, until we finally come to rest.
</p>

<p>
This spiking or firing behaviour is what we are trying to model.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org4bef71f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4bef71f">Historical Background</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4bef71f">
<p>
As it happens, we are not the first ones to try to do so. A couple of
years after Einstein's <i>annus mirabilis</i>, a french chap called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Lapicque">Louis
Lapicque</a> was also going through his own personal moment of
inspiration, the output of which was the seminal <a href="http://www.snv.jussieu.fr/brette/papers/Lap07.pdf">Recherches
quantitatives sur l'excitation électrique des nerfs traitée comme une
polarisation</a>. It is summarised <a href="http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~larry/AbbottBrResBul99.pdf">here</a> in fairly accessible English by
Abbot.
</p>

<p>
Lapicque had the insight of imagining the neuron as an RC circuit,
with the membrane potential's behaviour explained as the interplay
between capacitor and resistor; the action potential is then the
capacitor reaching a threshold followed by a discharge. Even with our
faint understanding of the subject matter, one cannot but appreciate
Lapique's brilliance to have the ability to reach these conclusions
in 1907. Of course, he also had to rely on the work of many others to
get there, let's not forget.
</p>

<p>
This model is still considered a useful model today, even though we
know so much more about neurons now - a great example of what we
mentioned before in terms of the choices of the level of detail when
modeling. Each model is designed for a specific purpose and it should
be as simple as possible for the stated end (but no simpler). As <a href="http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~larry/AbbottBrResBul99.pdf">Abbot
says</a>:
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
While Lapicque, because of the limited knowledge of his time, had no
choice but to model the action potential in a simple manner, the
stereotypical character of action potentials allows us, even today, to
use the same approximation to avoid computation of the voltage
trajectory during an action potential. This allows us to focus both
intellectual and computation resources on the issues likely to be most
relevant in neural computation, without expending time and energy on
modeling a phenomenon, the generation of action potentials, that is
already well understood.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org52154f7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org52154f7">The IAF Family</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org52154f7">
<p>
Integrate-and-Fire is actually a family of models - related because
all of them follow Lapicque's original insights. Over time, people
have addressed shortcomings in the model by adding more parameters and
modifying it slightly and from this other models were born.
</p>

<p>
In general, models in the IAF family are single neuron models with a
number of important properties (as per <a href="http://cns-classes.bu.edu/cn510/Papers/Izhikevich_Ch8.pdf">Izhikevich</a>):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The spikes are all or none; that is, we either spike or we
don't. This is a byproduct of the way spikes are added to the model,
as we shall see later. This also means all spikes are identical
because the are all created the same way.</li>
<li>The threshold for the spike is well defined and there is no
ambiguity as to whether the neuron will fire or not.</li>
<li>It is possible to add a refractory period, similarly to how we add
the spike. The refractory period is a time during which the neuron
is less excitable (e.g. ignores inputs) and occurs right after the
spike.</li>
<li>Positive currents are used as excitatory inputs and negative
currents as inhibitory inputs.</li>
</ul>

<p>
But how do the members of this family look like? We will take a few
examples from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_neuron_model">Wikipedia</a> to make a family portrait and then focus on
LIF.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9c084bf" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9c084bf">IAF: Integrate-and-Fire</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9c084bf">
<p>
This the Lapicque model. It is also called a "perfect" or "non-leaky"
neuron. The formula is as follows:
</p>

<p>
\[
I(t) = Cm\frac{dV_m(t)}{dt}
\]
</p>

<p>
The <code>m</code>'s are there to signify membrane, nothing else. Note that its
the job of the user to determine θ - that is the point at which the
neuron spikes - and then to reset everything to zero and start
again. If you are wondering why it's called "integrate", that's
because the differential equation must be integrated before we can
compare the current value to a threshold and then, if we're passed it,
well - fire!. Hence Integrate-and-Fire.
</p>

<p>
Wikipedia states this in a classier way, of course:
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
[This formula] is just the time derivative of the law of capacitance,
Q = CV. When an input current is applied, the membrane voltage
increases with time until it reaches a constant threshold Vth, at
which point a delta function spike occurs and the voltage is reset to
its resting potential, after which the model continues to run. The
firing frequency of the model thus increases linearly without bound as
input current increases.
</p>

<h3 id="org9eb2a92">Integrate-and-Fire with Refractory Period</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9eb2a92">
<p>
It is possible to extend IAF to take the refractory period into
account. This is done by adding a period of time t ref during which
the neuron does not fire.
</p>

<h3 id="orge601c14">LIF: Leaky Integrate-and-Fire</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge601c14">
<p>
One of the problems of IAF is that it will "remember" stimulus,
regardless of the time that elapses between stimuli. By way of
example: if a neuron gets some input below the firing threshold at
some time (say ta), then nothing for a long period of time and then
subsequent stimulus at say tb, this will cause the neuron to fire
(assuming the two inputs together are above the threshold). In the
real world, neurons "forget" about below-threshold stimulus after
certain amount of time has elapsed. This problem is solved in LIF by
adding a leak term to IAF. The Wikipedia's formula is like so:
</p>

<p>
\[
I_m(t) − \frac{V_m(t)}{R_m} = C_m\frac{dV_m(t)}{dt}
\]
</p>

<p>
We will discuss it in detail later on.

<h3 id="orgb0f91ab">Interlude: Leaky Integrators and Low-Pass Filters</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb0f91ab">
<p>
<b>Update</b>: this section got moved here from an earlier post.
</p>

<p>
Minor detour into the world of "Leaky Integrators". As it turns out,
mathematicians even have a name to describe functions like the one
above: they are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_integrator">Leaky Integrators</a>. A leaky integrator is
something that takes an input and "integrates" - that is, sums it over
a range - but by doing so, starts "leaking" values out. In order
words, a regular sum of values over a range should just result in an
ever growing output. With a leaky integrator, we add up to a point,
but then we start leaking, resetting the value of the sum back to
where we started off.
</p>

<p>
It turns out these kind of functions have great utility. For example,
imagine that you have a range of inputs varying from some arbitrary
low number to some other arbitrary high-number. When you supply these
inputs to a leaky integrator, it can be used to "filter out" the high
numbers; input numbers higher than a certain cut-off point just result
in zeros in the output. This is known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter">low-pass filter</a>. One can
conceive of a function that acted in the opposite way - a high-pass
filter.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgde19211">
<p>
In this model, spike generation is exponential:
</p>

<p>
\[
\frac{dX}{dt} = Δ_τ e^{\frac{X − X_t}{Δ_τ}}
\]
</p>

<p>
Wikipedia explains it as follows:
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
where X is the membrane potential, XT is the membrane potential
threshold, and ΔT is the sharpness of action potential initiation,
usually around 1 mV for cortical pyramidal neurons. Once the membrane
potential crosses XT, it diverges to infinity in finite time.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc743a15">
<p>
We could continue and look into other IAF models, but you get the
point. Each model has limitations, and as people work through those
limitations - e.g. try to make the spike trains generated by the model
closer to those observed in reality - they make changes to the model
and create new members of the IAF family.

<h2 id="orgca5fadf">Explaining the LIF Formula</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgca5fadf">
<p>
Let's look at a slightly more familiar formulation of LIF:
</p>

<p>
\[
τ_m\frac{dv}{dt} = −v(t) + RI(t)
\]
</p>

<p>
By now this should make vague sense, but lets do it step by step
breakdown just to make sure we are all on the same page. First, we
know that the current of the RC circuit is defined like so:
</p>

<p>
\[
I(t) = I_R + I_C
\]
</p>

<p>
From Ohm's Law we also know that:
</p>

<p>
\[
I_R = \frac{v}{R}
\]
</p>

And from the <a href="neurons_for_geeks_part_4.html">rigmarole of the capacitor</a> we also know that:
</p>

<p>
\[
I_C = C\frac{dv}{dt}
\]
</p>

<p>
Thus its not much of a leap to say:
</p>

<p>
\[
I(t) = \frac{v(t)}{R} + C\frac{dv}{dt}
\]
</p>

<p>
Now, if we now multiply both sides by R, we get:
</p>

<p>
\[
RI(t) = v(t) + RC\frac{dv}{dt}
\]
</p>

<p>
Remember that RC is τ, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC_time_constant">RC time constant</a>; in this case, we are
dealing with the membrane so hence the m. With that, the rest of the
rearranging to the original formula should be fairly obvious.
</p>

<p>
Also, if you recall, we mentioned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_integrator">Leaky Integrators</a> before. You should
hopefully be able to see the resemblance between these and our first
formula.
</p>

<p>
Note that we did not model spikes explicitly with this
formula. However, when it comes to implementing it, all that is
required is to look for a threshold value for the membrane potential -
called the spiking threshold; when that value is reached, we need to
reset the membrane potential back to a lower value - the reset
potential.
</p>

<p>
And with that we have enough to start thinking about code…

<p>
&#x2026; Or so you may think. First, a quick detour on discretisation. As
it happens, computers are rather fond of discrete things rather than
the continuous entities that inhabit the world of calculus. Computers
are very much of the same opinion as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Berkeley">the priest who said</a>:
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
And what are these same evanescent Increments? They are neither finite
Quantities nor Quantities infinitely small, nor yet nothing. May we
not call them the Ghosts of departed Quantities?
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
So we cannot directly represent differential equations in the
computer - not even the simpler ordinary differential equations
(ODEs), with their single independent variable. Instead, we need to
approximate them with a method for numerical integration of the
ODE. Remember: when we say integration we just mean "summing".
</p>

<p>
Once we enter the world of methods and numerical analysis we are much
closer to our ancestral home of Software Engineering. The job of
numerical analysis is to look for ways in which one can make discrete
approximations of the problems in mathematical analysis - like, say,
calculus. The little recipes they come up with are called numerical
methods. A method is nothing more than an algorithm, a set of steps
used iteratively. One such method is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method">Euler Method</a>: "[a] numerical
procedure for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with a
given initial value", as Wikipedia tells us, and as it happens that is
exactly what we are trying to do.
</p>

<p>
So how does the Euler method work? Very simply. First you know that:
</p>

<p>
\[
y(t_0) = y0
\]
</p>

<p>
\[
y′(t) = f(t, y(t))
\]
</p>

<p>
That is, at the beginning of time we have a known value. Then, for all
other t's, we use the current value in f in order to be able to
compute the next value. Lets imagine that our steps - how much we are
moving forwards by - are of a size \(h\). You can then say:
</p>

<p>
\[
t_{n + 1} = t_n + h
\]
</p>

<p>
\[
y_{n+1} = y_n + h \times f(x_n,t_n)
\]
</p>

<p>
And that's it. You just need to know where you are right now, by how
much you need to scale the function - e.g. the step size - and then
apply the function to the current values of x and t.
</p>

<p>
In code:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #339CDB; font-weight: bold;">template</span><span style="color: #C586C0;">&lt;</span><span style="color: #339CDB; font-weight: bold;">typename</span> <span style="color: #35CDAF;">F</span><span style="color: #C586C0;">&gt;</span>

    <span style="color: #35CDAF;">double</span> <span style="color: #85DDFF;">y</span> = y0;
    <span style="color: #339CDB; font-weight: bold;">for</span> <span style="color: #DB8E73;">(</span><span style="color: #339CDB; font-weight: bold;">auto</span> <span style="color: #85DDFF;">t</span><span style="color: #579C4C;">(</span>start<span style="color: #579C4C;">)</span>; t &lt; end; t += h<span style="color: #DB8E73;">)</span> <span style="color: #DB8E73;">{</span>
        y += h * f<span style="color: #579C4C;">(</span>t, y, h<span style="color: #579C4C;">)</span>;
    <span style="color: #DB8E73;">}</span>
<span style="color: #C586C0;">}</span>
</code></pre>

<p>
We are passing <code>h</code> to the function <code>F</code> because it needs to know about
the step size, but other than that it should be a pretty clean mapping
from the maths above.
</p>

<p>
This method is also known as Forward Euler or Explicit Euler.
